    "text": "Can you introduce yourself? My name is Jiwon Park. I'm 22 years old. I'm studying English and my major is also English Literature. But my English level is beginner. So I want to improve my English. Thank you. What are the things that you enjoy doing during your free time? My hobby is playing games. Online games? Yeah. Which games are you playing these days? I play Minecraft. Ah, Minecraft! That's a super popular one, right? Yeah. I see. Some of my friends spend hours and hours playing that game. I just know that game secondhand. I haven't played that game myself but I have seen some of my friends playing that game for hours. So it must be a bit addictive game, is it? Yeah. Any other games? No. I just only play that game. I see. How about your study? Is everything okay? Are you enjoying your major? No. No? Why not? Actually, I don't think that I'm excited about my major because there are many students who are good at English. Right. So I have to study more. Right. And you become insecure, right? Yeah. I know you can't really help but comparing yourself to other students, but then I recommend you try not to as much as you can because the more you try to compare it with each other, the less you get to enjoy it, right? Yes. Because studying English can be something that you can really enjoy. So don't let other students or your professors take that joy out of you. I see. Yeah, there must be a lot of students who have lived abroad and are already pretty fluent in the language, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah, that's a bit unfair because they don't really need to study English anymore if they were born in there or grew up in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anyways, do you consider any other majors? Yes. My second major is global architecture. Global architecture? Global marketing. Ah, global marketing. Yeah. I think it aligns with your main major, English literature. Yes. Ah, that's good. So, is that your passion? Your career path that you want to take? No. No? Yeah. To graduate my university, I have to choose two majors. Ah, so it's mandatory. So, yeah. I don't have any option. Right. Oh, I see. So, you're not really enjoying studying global marketing either? No. So, no, you're not enjoying, right? Yes. Oh, I see. I'm sorry to hear that. But I want to study English. You want to continue studying English? Yeah, continue, yeah. I see. That's good. Yeah, because as long as you can speak English, I mean, there gotta be opportunities. There's gotta be more opportunities, at least. Even in choosing the locations that you want to live in. Sorry? I mean, I said, you know, being able to speak English fluently, it gives you more opportunities, such as, you know, in choosing where to live, like which countries that you live in. Yes. I see. What else? So, if you think about your future, do you have clear picture of what you want to pursue as your career yet? Sorry, I couldn't hear your voice. Oh, okay. That's okay. It was wrong. So, I said, do you have clear idea of what you want to pursue as your career in the future? Or are you still figuring it out? My career? Yeah, your career. Sorry, I couldn't hear your voice. Oh, okay. So, do you have a clear idea about what you want to pursue as your career in the future? No. Not yet. I don't have a career, but I want to be a marketer or flight attendant. Flight attendant? Yeah. Interesting. Using English. I see. So, you must be interested in traveling, right? Yes. Have you ever been abroad? Yeah, I have been to China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Vietnam. Oh, wow. A lot of places. Yeah. Are you interested in traveling to English-speaking countries? No. No? Yeah. Why not? Because I always go to other countries with my friends, and my friends know my nature, so they... So they have high expectations? Yeah, so it is like a burden. Oh, right. Well, that's an interesting reason. Why don't you tell them, do not expect anything from me? I already told them, but they don't believe. Oh, yeah? Oh, no. Then you gotta actually go to English-speaking countries and demonstrate it. Yeah. Demonstrate that you are telling the truth. I'm kidding. I'm kidding. Anyways, I feel like your English is already good. You being able to understand and, you know, say what you want to say. So, I think that's enough. That's enough when you, you know, at least when it comes to traveling to another country. Because it's all about being able to understand and get your meaning across. But I have to work. Right. Because of your major. You know, like if you want to become a flight attendant, obviously you have to be more fluent in the language. Yeah, makes sense. Makes sense. So, I see. Anyways. Shall we stop here? It's 4 o'clock now.",

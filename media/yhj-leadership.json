    "text": "Okay, good. Then from the first question, so this talk was about leadership, right? Yeah. Yeah, so can you tell me about a time you worked with a great leader? What do you think made them a good leader? I think that the great leader is to empathize. Empathize? Empathize. A great leader is to empathize with their problems. Empathize with people's problems? Yeah, people's problems, yeah. Because people want to deal with their problems. Problems, rather than their instruction, guide instruction. So you mean... The detailed instructions is detailed guide and... Right, right, right. Detailed guide to help the people solve their problems, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah, I see. How about a time when you personally worked with a great leader? You know, about the situation, your personal experience with a great leader. So the great leader is to explain the backgrounds of the guild. I think there might be a bit of a misunderstanding. So the question is asking about your experience with a great leader in your life. So when was it? Who was this person? What was the relationship with this person? And what kind of interactions did you have with him that made you think that he's a good leader? Personally? Yeah, your personal experience with a good leader. Ah, okay. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I... Okay, I... The good leader is to emphasize my problems. Mm-hmm. So when was it? In the... In the problems, yeah. In the... Ah, I mean... Yeah, so your personal experience with a great leader. Okay. Yeah, so your personal experience with a great leader. Uh... You know, uh... Personal experience, uh... So you can start with when was it? Mm-hmm. And where was it? It might be in your company or it might be at your university. Mm-hmm. Ah, okay. Uh... In my company. In my company, uh... I... Uh... Mm... I entered... When I entered my company in... So... I entered first. Mm-hmm. So first, uh... So my boss, uh... My boss is to... Uh... So my boss is, uh... Your boss smiled at you? For the first time that you met each other? Uh, yeah, yeah. Mm-hmm. My boss is to, uh... So... You can use easy words, easy sentence structure. It doesn't have to be complicated. Ah. Mm... Yeah. Yeah, so what was the first impression with him? Mm... Uh... Yeah. When I made a mistake, uh, in... Uh... So, uh... About all those things. Mm-hmm. So, uh... My boss is to, uh... So, uh... Use the make sentence. Understood? Understood you? Yeah. Uh... Understood. Uh... Based on situation. Mm-hmm. Uh... So... So, uh... When I, uh... So, yeah. So, uh... Yeah, so he understood that everyone can make a mistake, right? Yes, yes. So he made you feel better about your mistakes. Yes, yeah. Mm, I see. So he was more of an understanding, considerate kind of person. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh... When I, uh... Uh, when I, uh... So, when I worked, uh... The first project with, uh... For the first time, for the first time. Mm-hmm. So, boss is, uh... Is to, uh... Teach me, teach me, uh... Detail the guide and... Uh, experience, uh... His experience. Mm, I see. Yeah, yeah. So he wasn't just understanding about your mistakes, but also help you grow and learn. Yes, yeah. Yeah, by teaching how things are done in the company. Yeah. And, you know, make sure that you understand by giving you lots of details, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Uh, because I, I don't, uh... I don't have, uh, marketing career in the, uh... At that time? At the time, yeah. At the time, so... I don't know, uh... I don't know that, uh... What is the marketing. Mm. Is to communicate with the customers. Right. Ah, so he also taught you, you know, all about, all about marketing. Like basic, you know, 101 about marketing. Yes, yes. Mm. So my boss is to teach me, uh... Marketing strategy. Marketing strategy? Yeah, marketing strategy, yeah. Mm, I see. Yeah, and... And, uh... The success point, yeah, is to, uh... Execute. Execute, uh... Execute? Marketing. Execute, yeah. Execute. Execute the marketing plan, yeah. Success point. So, uh... At the time, I... Uh... Uh... Mm... I... I got help. I... You got help? Yeah. Mm-hmm. What kind of help? You got help with, uh... What kind of help? What kind of help? Mm... Uh... Uh... So, uh... I... Uh... I helped. Uh... Uh... She helped. She helped me, so... Uh... Uh... Uh... Also helped... Helped me... What? Uh... Shirt? Shirt? Buzok? Buzok? Buzok? Buzok? Leg? Leg. Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... He... He helped... He... Um... Helped you, uh... Improve... Improve your... The parts that you lack? Oh, yeah, yeah. Mm, right? Mm. Uh... Yes, he helped me... Lack of the... Uh... What's it? Uh... My... Ability. Ability, yeah. Mm-hmm. And... Yeah, and, uh... Uh... Yeah, and I... Uh... I made... I made... Ah, yeah. You were influenced or you got affected by... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... By... You were influenced, or you got affected? He's influence. Mm-hmm. He's... He influenced you? He's influenced. He's affected by, uh... Improving my skills, yeah. Mm, I see. Yeah. Or you can say he encouraged you to improve your skills. Yes. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah, he does sound like a good leader. Yeah. So... So I still, I felt, uh... It's... Mm... I felt, uh... It's a fight that is important to, uh... Feelings, or make feelings. Make, uh... Emphasize? Sympathize? Sympathize, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Emphasize my boss, and... Emphasize, I don't know, my boss. You mean... Emphasize your team members? Or your boss? Boss, boss. With your boss? Ah, no, no, no. No? Emphasize team, team. Oh, you empathize with him now? Yeah, yeah, with him now. Ah, because you're working as a leader now, right? Yes, yes, yeah. Ah, I see, I see, I see. Got it. Mm, and then you... So you're trying to become like him or better when you're dealing with your team members? Uh... Uh, yeah. Uh... I want, uh... Uh, I want to, uh... I want to teach, uh... Ah, no. I want to try, uh... Try... Try to teach them or let them know? Let them know, let them know about, uh... My boss' leadership, yeah. Mm, I see. That's good. Yeah, he sounds like a really good leader. Yeah. Uh, how about a bad leader you've had? What do you think made them a bad leader? Mm... I think, uh, that bad leader is, uh... Don't have responsibility of this, uh... I don't know. All the things. Everything? Everything. Ah, so he doesn't have responsibility about anything. He can say anything. Yeah, anything. Because, uh... Leader, uh... Leader... Leader... Ah, leader, uh... So... Employees? Employees. Ah, right, okay. Uh... Employees... Employees execute, uh... All the, uh... Anything. Ah, no. Execute the project. Project. It's, uh... Project. Uh, leader needs to authority. Uh, leader needs to singing. Ah, approve. Approve, ah. So, uh, leader is, uh... Leader... Leader have to responsibility. Mm-hmm. But... Leader has to be responsible? Yeah. Leader has to be responsible, uh... With anything, yeah. Mm, right. Uh, if you can't think of a word to say, then you can replace it with easier words. Like, when you can't think of a word, approve, for example, then you can just say, uh, say okay or say no, you know? Mm, okay. Yeah. Uh, because in, you know, in casual conversation situations, uh, it's all about the flow, right? And all about getting your meaning across. So, you don't have to be perfect at all. And, you know, if you really go to other countries, they don't really care about your vocabularies or your, you know, grammatic errors. You know, they, or whether, you know, you're speaking it perfectly or not. They only care about what you got, what you've got to say. And, you know, as long as they understand, then it's all good. Yeah, like, trust me, they don't really care. They, I think what they care is more about how comfortable you are in that situation. How comfortable you are in speaking in English. But in that way, if you use easy words, they don't care because they understand you are from different countries. Uh, so, you know, it's understandable. As long as you're comfortable. Comfortable and confident. So, you know, don't try to use all the, okay, all the words that you would say in Korean. Just, you know, replace it with easier words. The things that you, that pops up into your head. Yeah. It doesn't have to be perfect. Yes. Okay. Next question. Have you ever been in a leadership role? I already know an answer to this question, which is yes, right? What was that experience like for you? And how would you evaluate your own leadership? Evaluate means \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub2e4. \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub2e4. Yeah. Is, uh, yeah, in my company, I, uh, I am marketing management. Yeah. So, uh, I, uh, I evaluate my, uh, leadership to, to accomplish. Yeah. Accomplish is, uh, is our KPI in the company. So it's KPI is key, uh, performance indicator. So you, you evaluate your own leadership using KPI? Yeah. Oh. Because, uh. Sorry. Uh, because all the thing, uh, uh, because, uh, no, I, uh, because I have to, uh, I have to. You have to. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh, I have to, uh, go work. Mm-hmm. Oh, no. Go work. You have to work? I have to work. I have to work, uh, with my team. Uh. It's team, uh, but, uh, I, uh, I explain, uh, uh, some, uh. Important? Uh. Important? Uh. Important. Importance. Importance. Mm. Uh. I have to explain, uh, importance, uh, the, the KPI is, is, uh, one more. Uh. Oh. Importance of KPI. Ah, importance of KPI. Yeah. Oh. Oh, I see. Uh. So. Mm. Yeah. So when, uh, KPI is accomplished, is accomplished, is the, my leadership is, uh, to, uh, evaluate. Ah. So if your, if your team member's KPI is high, then they evaluate your leadership as good? Yes. Yes. So it's about numbers, is it? Yeah. Uh. Oh, I see. So, uh, I think, uh, um, indicator is very important. Mm-hmm. Uh, so as long as the number in KPI are high, then you would evaluate yourself as good leader? Yes. Oh, I see. I see. Mm. Do you think the evaluating system with KPI is perfect? Mm. Because, because in this, in this, uh, talk. Yeah. Uh, they emphasize that it's not about numbers, right? But it seems like you're talking about numbers. Mm-hmm. So it's interesting. Uh, uh, yeah, uh, in the company, it's very important to accomplish the KPI. Right. So, uh, my leadership is to, is to show, show, yeah. Then my question is, how do you encourage your team members to, you know, increase their KPI? Mm. Yeah. Uh, first, um, I, uh, I try to explain, uh, so the background in the, uh, umu. A background of the work or job? Work. Mm-hmm. So it's this, uh, this, uh, umu. Task? I don't know. Tasks? Task. Task, yeah. Task. It's an, uh, an, uh, an, uh, and I, uh, yeah. I, I try to recognize, uh, uh, them, uh, output. Ah. So, like telling them good job when they did a good job, right? Yeah. Oh, that was good. Or thank you for your effort and stuff like that. Yes, yes, yeah. Mm. So appreciating their efforts. Appreciate them, yeah. Appreciating their efforts. Mm. That's good. Yeah. Mm. Excellent. Uh, and, uh, and I, and I try to one-on-one meeting. Mm. Communicate with one-on-one meeting, yeah. Mm-hmm. It's, uh, once a month. It's, uh, one-on-one meeting is to, uh, listen? Listen to? Uh, listen. Mm-hmm. Uh, yeah, listen to their, uh, the problems, uh, to execute, uh, the projects, yeah. Oh, that's very good. Yeah. Yeah. And, and I, uh, uh, and I, and I know there are the problems, uh, in the projects I, I execute. So, uh. Mm. I deal with their problems in their team, yeah. Mm. I see. Oh. You sound like a good leader yourself. Yeah. Do you think so too? Uh, a little, yeah. A little bit? That's good. Uh, do your team members think so too? Uh, yeah, yeah. My team is so, I think, yeah. Mm. So they will say, thank you, or I'm lucky to have you as my leader, and things like that? Mm. Uh, my team is, it's not express to. Ah, they're not very, very expressive. Yeah. They're a bit shy. Yeah. Okay, understandable. What you can feel with their body language or, you know, their, their eyes or things like that. Yes. Right. Mm. Good, good. Uh, next question. So, you know, in the talk, uh, he, he, the speaker had his own view about great leadership, right? So do you agree with the talk? You know, what the talk said about good leadership? Why or why not? If not, why not? Mm. Uh, yeah, I agree. Yeah, I agree. Mm, I see. When I saw the, uh, the YouTube of Ted, uh, so I, mm, I think, uh, uh, leadership, uh, to emphasize the, the, their problem. Mm-hmm. Uh, rather than, it's, uh, so there are instructions. Mm. And, and the people think it's the people, uh, it's people, uh, people think, people's feeling. Right. Yeah. And then the, one of the important key, important keywords was safety, right? Safety, yes. Yeah, they have to feel safe in the organization. Yeah, yeah. Mm. Yeah. Because a lot of times people don't feel safe in their organization. Mm. If their performance is low, then they always worry about getting fired. Right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. So. And then that, you know, oh, uh-huh. Oh, yeah. So, uh, good leadership is to make the, uh, the people, the, uh, comfortable? Comfortable? Yeah, comfortable. Yeah, safety. Mm. So. Yeah, I think it's tricky part because a lot of organization, they have to make money, right? Mm. So I think, uh, the easiest way to do it is to, you know, push them, push them to increase their performance and their productivity. Yeah. But I feel like, you know, you know, people have to be more wise in a sense. Yes, yes. Yeah. Because, you know, if they want something, they just directly tell them to do what they want. Then I feel like it's a, it's kind of a lazy leadership. They have to make them want to do what they want them to do, you know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mm. Yes. Yeah. So, the last question. Uh, what part of the talk stood out to you the most? Most impressive to you the most? Stood out? Uh. Stood out? Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Uh. Okay, okay. So. Um. Uh. Uh. Um. Yeah. Uh. In a tent. Uh. In a tent. Uh. In a tent. Uh. In a tent. Uh. I. I agree that, uh, it's, uh, people, uh, are good leader. Good leadership is to, to, uh, make them safety and comfortable. It's, uh. And feelings. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So. I agree that. Yeah. Mm-hmm. And. So. So I. Uh. I think. Uh. Uh. It is important to communicate with, uh, is, uh, 100 million, and with my team is, uh, it's the same. Yeah. It's kind of. Yeah. You're trying to make them feel that you have their back, right? Yes. Yeah. I'm here to help you when you have problems. Yeah. Mm. Yes. Yes. Mm. I think that's really good. Yeah. Um, what about, do you, like, any examples that you remember from the talk? Uh. You know, he gave examples where, like, the soldier, the general gives a kiss. Oh. To an injured soldier, or, you know, a lot of examples he, he, he gave. Oh, is it, uh, in the TED YouTube chat? Mm. YouTube? Mm-hmm. Oh, okay. Mm. Oh, yeah. I, uh, in the TED, uh, uh. It's, uh, troops, troops. Mm-hmm. Uh, I don't know. Sergeant, no? Sergeant is to make them sacrifice. Mm. Is to, uh, is to, uh, save the wounded people. Mm. Right. It's so, uh, it's very, uh, it's good leadership. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. It's very good. Yeah, I think so, too. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's impressive because there is so much more at stake because they're risking their lives, right? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Not just about money or performance. Yeah. It's about their actual lives. They might die going into the fire to save their soldiers, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. Mm. So I think that's why it's so impressive. Yeah. They have to be willing to sacrifice themselves to do that. Yeah. Yes. Mm. Do you think you can do that? Are you willing to sacrifice for your team members? Uh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, uh, I felt lack of my leadership, but I make them safe and comfortable. And so when they have problems, I want to handle this problem right away. Yeah. Mm. Right. Right. Mm. Mm. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. By the way, you're already sacrificing your time and effort to have one-on-one meeting with your team members. Right? Yes. Yes. Yes. Because, you know, during that time you can do your own work or own tasks. Mm. Mm. I see. Makes sense. By the way, have you seen this movie? Saving Private Ryan? Uh. Uh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. I saw. Going back to the war zone just to save that one soldier, right? Yes. Yes. Ryan. Yeah. It was impressive. I just saw this movie once, but I think I liked it. Mm. Mm. I see. Today. Mm. Mm. Yeah. I was moving. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Mm. Good. Mm. ",

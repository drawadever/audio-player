    "text": "Many friends, specifically on time and location, where and behavior, I have to read paper, one paper related to my topic, yeah, I set that, set them on my calendar or cell phone, yeah. So when I have alarm, in some time, I check my schedule and I have a duty to do for it, yeah, I feel duty. So you gave me a good example of cues for habits, right? How it can lead to good habits, so then how does it make it an entire context? How are each examples related to each other to create an entire context? I think these changes can make an entire change. How? Can you explain it more? How? How? Yeah. Stack, have a stacking. Entire change. Entire change, have a stacking? Yeah, I mean, little by little, change our pattern, habit, bad habit to good habit, we can accomplish entire change. Little by little, we can make a change. Right, but I'm wondering, because it says the context is the cue, right? So I feel like it's not merely talking about one specific cue, it's talking about the relationship of multiple cues and how they relate to each other to create a context, right? So I want you to explain more about how that works. How does each cue combine to make an entire context? I can't think of it. Because it says here, over time, your habits become associated not with a single trigger, but with the entire context surrounding the behavior, right? So there must be some kind of relation. Relation? Yeah, relationship between... He remarks of relation? Yeah, he must have. Relation? I don't know this book, but I don't remember relation. Actually, frankly, this part is just one. Make the big part of your life, make the cue be part of your environment. This is not it. Go to a new place. Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work. Take a break from the space? He said to take a break from the space. Habits in one place... No, this is not the entire thing. Do you understand? I think a little bit. Yeah, what is the entire change? I think it's about one habit. It's related to the entire context, so it's not related to a single cue. For example, if you have a bad habit to use your phone every day, it's not only related to the fact that you have a phone, but the place that you place your phone before you go to bed and the physical tiredness before you go to bed. Maybe you are not tired enough, so you have more energy to use your phone. That can be another context. And another one is that maybe you have your friend talking about certain YouTuber at work all the time. So you want to catch up on the new news to talk about with them and socialize with them. So that can be another context. So in one habit that you use your phone every night, it's not just about having a phone. It has multiple contexts surrounded by it. So you have to consider the context around the habit to properly fix it and make it a good habit. So I think it talks about that. Right? Last you said, what about? So I think it says about one habit or one behavior that you do regularly is associated with so many things. Your relationship, your social circle, the kind of person that you hang out with. Also the time that you go to bed and the amount of workout that you do each day. I feel tired. Yeah, if you feel tired, you may get better sleep. Right? But if you don't work out and you're not tired enough, maybe you have more energy to use your phone every night and stuff like that. So the amount of workout that you do, the kind of friend that you're hanging out with, or just people that you sleep with. Maybe he also wakes up late at night. Always use your cell phone. So you tend to use your cell phone as well because he's using it as well. He's not sleeping. Things like that. Everything can affect your habit, affect your behavior. So when you think about a behavior, you have to expand your view to the entire context surrounding it. So I think that's what it's talking about. Right? Yeah. So when you try to change a behavior, you might consider making big changes. Right? Thinking about, yeah, starting with the kind of people that you hang out with. Maybe you try to cut off alcohol. Then you shouldn't just have strong willpower to say no every time that your friend asks you to. Maybe you have to make a decision to hang out with them less and make new friends who drink less. Yeah, things like that. And maybe you go to... Is that the entire thing? What do you mean? Just one habit is to place the phone on the desk before going to bed. You can try to place the phone apart from me. This can change the relationship. You mean... Yeah, I mean, no, no, no, no. No? So just focusing on one cue maybe would be the place. Then maybe you try to put your phone away from your bed before going to bed. Yeah. Right? But then for some people, it might not work. Maybe because their room is basically too small. Too small. That everything is in your arms reach. You can reach everything in your arms reach. Or you always have a friend that talks to you at night. Talks? Talks to you at night. Message. Yeah, you have a friend in, I don't know, in New Zealand or in America that talks to you every time on that day. And it's usually before you go to bed. Usually. Yeah, maybe you make a phone call with your friend every 11 p.m. at night. Then you can't place your phone away from your bed because you have this friend who you talk to you every night. Yeah, right. Yeah, so maybe just focusing on one cue would not be enough. You have to consider the entire context that encourages you to do this bad behavior. Hmm, yeah. Okay, okay. This environment can make our bad habits. Yeah. Yeah. Because my relationship or... It can be everything. Everything. Yeah, everything related to it. It can disturb making good habits. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. So, just by one trigger, we have to consider the entire thing. Yeah. Entire thing means... Yeah, when you try to... Relation or my work. Anything that is associated with it. Anything that's associated with it. Hmm. Hmm. Anything that might contribute to the behavior. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Entire context surrounding the behavior. Hmm. Hmm. Context becomes the cue. So, we have purpose to make a good habit. Yeah. So, we have to control this entire context. Exactly. How can you manage it? Do I manage personally? Yeah. I'm not doing a very... Not personally. It's generally. For example. Yeah. Right? Hypothetically. Yeah. Maybe... Maybe... This guy said about that? In this book? Yeah. In this chapter? Here. Uh... Trying to eat healthier? Apple? Here. Hmm. Hmm. For example, many people drink more in social situations than they would ever drink alone. So, the trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the whole situation. Yeah. Watching your friends order drinks. Hearing the music at the bar. Seeing the bars on the tab. Everything can be the cue. Right? For you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ventriloquism. Our habits to location in which they occur. The home. The office. The gym. Each location develops a connection to certain habits and routines. Right. So, this thing talk about relationship. This thing talk about locations. Right? And this thing talk about objects in the environment. So, object can also can be a cue for a behavior. Right? Um... This is a useful way to think about the influence of the environment on your behavior. Yeah. Stop thinking about your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled with relationships. Stop thinking. Start thinking. Start thinking. How do you think in terms of how you interact with the spaces around you? For one person, for a couch, it's a place where she needs... For one person, her couch is a place where she reads for an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches television. And it's a bowl of ice cream after work. So, it's the same couch, but it has different context depending on the person. Right? Different people can have different memories and thoughts, different habits associated with the same place or same cues. Because I don't drink alcohol. If I see beer or if I go to a bar, it does nothing for me. It doesn't work as a cue. But you, you have a habit of drinking. So, if you go to a bar and see a tap of beer, then it is a cue for you to order a drink. But for me, it does nothing. I would order a bottle, glass of orange juice. Yeah, by person. Yeah, it depends on the person. Depends on your memory. So, you can train yourself to link a particular habit with a particular context. So, you can utilize this to create habits or break habits in your favor. Entire context surrounding behavior. Yeah. So, it can be the place. Is this related to entire context? Yeah, because it's talking about... I can't catch the idea exactly. You can't? Entire context surrounding. Instead, it just means one space, one use. I understand. No, it doesn't only talk about that. Only talk about that? It's one example. One example. Just one example. Yeah, it's just one example. As it says, it can be about relationship. No, no, no. Whole life is too general, it's too wide. So, it's harder to understand, right? One behavior can relate to your relationship, right? Or it can be related to its place. Relationship is one example. Yeah, just only one example. Place is also just one example. Object is also one example. So, we have to consider entire context surrounding us. Right. The kind of people that we hang out. Or space, time, guys. Yeah, the location that we are at. Either if we are at home, or we are at a cafe, or we are at work. And if you are at home, the kind of object that surrounds us. So, he said the context becomes the cue. Exactly, exactly. Okay, next one. It's easier to build new habits in a new environment. Because you are not fighting against old cues. Makes sense. Can you give me an example? Now? Easy, easy one. So, give me an example. One example. Yeah, I understand this sentence. I want to exercise. I make exercise to my routine. But I didn't do it. I couldn't do it every time. I think I didn't have time to exercise, to work out. But actually, I visited the gym for ping pong. Table tennis? Yeah. I visited twice a week. I like the ping pong. And I made a relationship with other people. I think exercise, workout with people is productive to me. I can be familiar with people. You can become familiar with the people? Yeah. Or acquainted with people. Yeah, acquainted. I think it's a nice change. Right, right. So, in that way, working in a new environment, you're creating a bunch of new cues. Right? New cues for you to exercise regularly. Yeah. The relationship that you're building there. Those kind of people, they exercise regularly. They motivate you so that you get to work more. And if you go there, you always exercise there. So, if you see the place and you see the people, then you know it's time to work out. So, that entire place is the cue. And even the object that you use regularly. Maybe you can use a certain type of racket every day. It's your racket. Racket to play ping pong. Racket, yeah. Maybe there is a favorite racket for you. It grabs nicely. And it's light. And it's perfect for you. If you grab it, then you feel like, oh, now I'm ready. It can be another cue. Right? Maybe you might have a routine to bounce your ball like that. It can be another cue for you. Everything can be a new cue for you to work out in that environment. So, it's good cues, right? To encourage you. Then what about the old cues that stop you from working out at your old place? For example, at your home. What are the cues that block you from working out? Block you? Maybe you can try working out at home, right? You can do home training, which is popular these days. Watching YouTube videos. Then what is the reason that it's so hard to do at home? I don't like exercise at home. Yeah? And why? Because I want to make the home for sleeping or enjoying. Watching the movie or like this. Yeah. Right. Yeah, leisure. Enjoy the leisure at home. Exactly. And that's what you used to do at your home. So, if you go to home, then your body becomes a relaxed mode. Relaxed. That is a cue. The entire home itself is a cue for you to relax. So, you're not in the mood for workout. So, I have a habit. Turn the light. It's a yellow light. Before I leave the room, leave the home. So that it's going to be relaxing for you. Yeah, so I arrived at home. I feel relaxed feeling. Because the yellow light comforts me. Right. But then it's going to be a cue, old cue that blocks you from workout. Blocks? Blocks. It blocks you from workout. Blocks me from workout. From workout. Because it's relaxing. It demotivates you to workout. Right. And maybe you try to workout watching YouTube videos. Then you grab your phone. But then you have this habit to do everything but watching exercise videos. Right. It has bunch of cues. Millions of cues that attracts you. Right. You go to YouTube video. But never ever. I've been watching the YouTube for ping pong tennis. Yeah, table tennis. Yeah, right. But then when you open the YouTube, there's less likely that you would search exercise. And then see the exercise video and workout. Because it's so addictive and attractive. There's so many attractive things that you can do. Million things that you can do. Right. So, that is the example of old cues that blocks you from workout at home. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Okay. Good. Good. Next time, we'll go to 7, 8.",

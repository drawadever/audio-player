    "text": "Women can have more psychological problems than men, guys. Output is a psychological problem. Independent variable is a psychological problem. Independent variable is male or female. So, female, relatively to men, have more risk for psychological problems. For example, not real. In this case, we can use a ratio. Because men and women, this ratio equals 1. 1 and men ratio equals 1? Men and women ratio is 1. Like 1 vs 1 or 1 vs 2 or something like that? Ratio? What is ratio? Women, for men, ratio is 1. In this case, ratio. Then, is it 28% or 58%? You can say that. In this case, ratio equals 1. 1. Right. In this case, ratio equals 1. If 1 is added, there is no meaning. 1 is the same. If a woman has a lot of money, then the ratio should be greater than 1. If a woman has a lot of psychological problems, then the ratio should be greater than 1. Ratio should be greater than 1. If a woman has a lot of psychological problems, then the ratio should be greater than 1. In this case, the ratio should be greater than 1. In this case, the ratio should be greater than 1. If the ratio is lower than 1, what will happen? There will be less women. The risk should be lower. But I don't understand. I don't know why they call it a ratio. The reason why they call it a ratio is because there is a probability analysis. There is a probability analysis. There is a result. What should I say? Let's look at the weight. Age, weight, male and female. When you look at the weight, the average weight is a few kilograms. It should be a few kilograms. There are all the characteristics that men have. If it's a few kilograms, it's lower than the average. It should be higher or higher. The average of the sample group is higher than the sample group. It should be like that. Then what are the factors? So we have to analyze the cause. Why is the cause like that? Why are these people higher than the average? We have to analyze whether it is high or low. What is the factor? What is the risk factor? That's why it's called a risk ratio. Risk ratio. I don't know why they call it a ratio. The ratio is the probability of something. How many times? How many times? Ratio. It's a probability, and it's a few times. But how many times do you usually say? How many times? So how many times is the probability that these people will have it compared to the general situation? That's right. Oh, that's why it's called a ratio. I have this factor, but how many times is the probability that these people will become obese? So if there is work, if there is work in the interior, it doesn't mean much. Whether the work is here or here. So if there is work, it means that it comes out the same as the average person. That's right. It doesn't matter. Then if 0.8 comes out, it's a little lower than before. Then the risk is low. These people. If it's bigger than work, these people are more dangerous than those people. Oh. That's it. Oh. So in this case, there's a reason why it shouldn't be included in this section. Yes. But I don't understand this graph. This table. There's no ratio. There's no ratio, but I think this is a ratio. Estimate. But this is the effect size. There was some effect, but how much is the effect? Yes. This is the ratio. This is the error range. Is it a standard error range? There may be. Ah. Yes. This is it now. It's a standard error. Standard error. If you look at this, there's no work. But there's no work between 30 and 30, but it's meaningful. So the baseline is pre-treatment. So before treatment. Baseline was pre-treatment. And they are comparing the result of post and follow-up results with the baseline result, which was pre-treatment results. So they are comparing baseline, pre-treatment, and post-treatment results here. And here they are comparing pre-treatment and follow-up results. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. So they are not comparing these two. No. They are comparing this, this, and this, this respectively. Yes. So I can see that. Without number one, so without this range, this does not include one. So it's effective. Uh-huh. 20.33. Uh-huh. The post-treatment is effective. Uh-huh. This is significant. Not significant. Acceptance. Not significant. Not significant. Because 0.94. It includes one. Right. Not significant. Significant. Significant. Uh-huh. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. Oh, is this one significant? Significant. It's clarity. Follow-up. It's this group. Less than. Less than. Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The result was, the follow-up treatment result was below, relatively low. Yeah. Than the results of pre-treatment. Yeah. Pre-treatment result. Yeah, so it was complicated. See? And I still can't find it. Yeah, but then the measurement only conducted three times. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up. So it was three months after the treatment. After they ended the treatment. No, no, no, no. No. There's two groups, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're comparing active and sham groups, and the time factor as well. Just two. ANCOVA, yeah. It means \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. ANCOVA. Yeah. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815. \ubc18\ubcf5 \uce21\uc815.

That was about the ANVOC, ANCOVA. \uc544 \uc774\uac70 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6cc. Yeah, exactly. And actually they said Linear Mixed Effect Model is more advanced than ANCOVA. \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uadf8\uac8c \ub2e4 \uadf8\ub798. \uc694\uc0c8. \uc774\uac70 \ud55c\ubc88 \uc9c0\uc740\uc774 \ubd10\ubd10\uc694. \uc704\uc5d0 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ud559\uc790 \uc788\uc744 \uac83 \uac19\uc740\ub370. \uc774 \ud37c\ube14\ub9ad \ud5ec\uc2a4 \uc774 \uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 \ubb54\uac00 \ud1b5\uacc4 \ucabd \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub124. \uc624 \uc640\uc6b0. Yale University. I know that university. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \ud37c\ube14\ub9ad \ud5ec\uc2a4 \uc800\ucabd \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc740 \uadf8\ub7f0 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774\uc5d0\uc694. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubcf4\ud5d8\uacf5\ub2e8. \uadf8\ub807\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ube45\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ub2f4\uc73c\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc774\uc5d0\uc694. Right. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub2c8\uae4c \uc800\ub7f0 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4\uc740 \uc774\uc81c statistician\uc774\uc9c0. Makes sense. Because it is difficult, right? It is natural for us to not understand it, right? We can't do this analysis. Yeah, it was crazy. Statistician joined this article. Yeah, because it's very complicated, right? And then if people like us, they come up with the statistics, there's high probability that we're going to mess it up, right? If you're not statistic expert, we're going to mess it up. There's going to be mistakes. We need background of statistics for reading this article, I think. It's very difficult. But we can just read about research and what is meaning of research. We have to catch them. But we don't understand fully this article. Yeah, so what bothered me was I could understand these figures. Because it was just a mean score, right? So I could understand this. But I couldn't understand this figure because it didn't look like scores, right? But it was like, I don't know how to interpret it. But then here it mentioned p-value. So they put this asteroid here, indicating the statistical significance. So if there's two, it's more significant. And there's three, even more significant, right? So I could only interpret this. Okay, this is significant, whatever. I don't know how they figured it out. But they say it is, and then it is. It is. But you have a problem because it's more significant not... No, no, no, here, here. Meaningless, meaningless. Just, I think it's... Specific. Because p-value is changeable when type of statistics are used. Yeah, makes sense. So they set the p-value differently. But then I heard that... P under this point is more significant than this? No, no. This doesn't... P-value always, like below 0.05, 0.01, it's all significant. Is this not more significant than this? No, no. But they say it's more significant. No, it's the same, it's the same. It's all the same. But that's how they explained it here. Who? That's how they explained it here. I heard that the figure here indicates the possibility that this result was from coincidence. Right? Below 0.05, it means there's only 5% of possibility that the result was by coincidence. And 0.01 means it's just 1% of possibility that this result was by accident. And this one, 0.1% of possibility that this result was from coincidence. So it means it was more significant from my understanding. That's right, I studied this. It's all meaningful. It's all meaningful, but the ones that aren't are meaningless. The ones that are meaningful are all meaningful, but the ones that are more meaningful are more significant. Very significant. Why didn't you upload the travel English class? Ah, the travel English class? Ah, if you have something like that, you should have told me. I was going to upload it. No, I saw it in advance, and you said you couldn't upload it, so I didn't upload it. But I do do that. I know. I do do that. Should I do it? Should I do the travel English class today? Yes, let's do the travel English class. Good, good. The travel English class is at 6 o'clock. Ah, this is really... But I'm curious about something. In the conversation feedback, there are 6 voices, right? Yes. How do you get these voices? How do you get these voices? I made a program with JTBC. If I have a question, can I make this? Yes, how did you make this? I really like this voice. There's a Korean collaborator. I use this. Text, there's a paid version. Ah, really? I did the coding myself. With the collab? Yes, but I didn't do it. Chatspity did it. So, after running this, I use Chatspity's text to speech API. Yes. So, I use the API, but I have to pay a little. There's something like a few cents per second. It's not that expensive. So, if you put in about 10,000 won, you can use it for a long time. So, it's not that expensive, so I'm using it. Yes. I like this voice. How did you choose this voice? How did I choose it? Yes. There's something they provide. Speech to text open AI. Ah, text to speech. I think I have it, too. I don't have that voice. If you do text to speech open AI, They all have voices. So, if you put it on the text to speech, If you put it on, will you read it? Yes. I see. And the coding is much better than when I made it. So, I can make it in one go. It took me a long time. It took me a long time. I can make it in one go. Anyway, using the text to speech open AI API, I put some money in it and used it. It can be automatically charged. So, it's not free. So, I'll show you. How far can I go? There's a transportation method. Transportation method. Then, Transportation method? Transportation method? Isn't it? Entering and leaving the country. Searching for luggage. Reporting new cargo. Transferring the plane. Transportation method. Entering and leaving the country. Entering and leaving the country. Isn't this the transportation method? Isn't it? Why didn't you do it? I didn't. What is it? What is it? Is it mine? Yes. It is. Yes. March 2nd? What is it? March 2nd. Did I do it again? Did I do something else? I can't see it. You can't see it? Yes. I didn't give you the authority. No sense. Entering and leaving the country. Can you see it now? Now? I can't see it. You can enter. Entering and leaving the country. Entering and leaving the country. I can see it. Let's do it. Was it this today? No. Was it this when I went abroad? Arrived at the airport. Did we do all of this? Yes, we did. Then this is right. I didn't do it last time. I didn't do it last time. But... Or... Today... Should we do a small talk scenario? I have to write the dictation part, but I haven't written it yet. Should we do a small talk scenario? I have to write the dictation part, but I haven't written it yet. Let's talk about the performance on behalf of this. Let's talk about the performance on behalf of this. Talking? With who? First... First, with the person I met for the first time. Small talk. I'll start with writing the dictation part. Isn't it window practice? Yes, window practice... Not window practice... Oh, writing the dictation part? I'll do the window practice first. I'm out of my mind. I met him for the first time at a cafe. Jessica and Emily met. Jessica came to the cafe and said, Hey, can I sit here for a moment? I was waiting for the coffee. For a moment? I'm waiting for my coffee. Exactly. Good. I'm waiting for my coffee. Of course. If you say, can I have a seat? It can be a little awkward. It's better to say, can I sit here? Can I sit here? Can I sit here? If you say, can I have a seat? It feels like you're sitting in your seat. It's not just sitting here for a moment. If you say, can I have a seat? It's like, sit comfortably and sit in your seat. But here, it's the first time I've come to someone I don't know. Can I sit here for a moment? Just simply, can I sit here for a moment? For a moment? When you say, can I have a seat? It's been standing for a long time. It's been standing for a long time. It's been standing for a long time, but it looks like there's a place to sit. So at that time, can I have a seat? You can say, can I have a seat? At that time, you don't say, can I sit here? It's like, can I have a seat? It's kind of like this. You don't know what kind of nuance it is yet, do you? No, well... When I'm comfortable, I say, sit down, please. Sit here? Can I sit here? That's how you say it. That's right. Can I sit? You can just do it simply like this. Because sit can be used like this. But have a seat feels a little more comfortable. It's have a seat. It's like, take your seat, your seat. Can I sit comfortably? Can I sit in my seat? Or you sit comfortably. Have a seat. It's used when you say, sit comfortably. In this context, it's more natural to say, can I sit here for a moment? Can I sit here for a moment? Can I sit here for a moment? I'm waiting for my coffee. But I'll try something else here. You can express it like this. Can you use the word mind? Mind. What does mind mean? Dazzling. That's right. Dazzling. Do you mind? Dazzling. Do you mind? Do you mind me sitting here for a moment? That's good. Grammatically, To sit here for a moment. Grammatically, it's perfect. Is it to sit? But it's a little more natural to say, do you mind if? Do you mind if? Then what should I do? If I sit here? That's right. For a moment. Do you mind if I sit here for a moment? Do you mind if I sit here for a moment? And in many cases, do you is omitted. Mind if I sit here for a moment? Oh, really? Mind if I sit here for a moment? Mind if I sit here for a moment? That's right. It's often omitted. Then what should I do if the answer is okay? That's okay. Of course. Oh, exactly. But when it's a yes or no question. Yes, sure. No. Yes, I don't mind. You can't say yes. Oh, I don't mind. Oh, I don't mind is okay. But you have to say, no, I don't mind. No, I don't mind. If you say, yes, I don't mind, it's wrong. They'll understand. Because I said, I don't mind. But if you say yes, they'll understand the opposite. Oh, of course I don't like it. Don't sit? Yes. What do you mean? Of course. Of course I don't mind. I do mind. No, I don't mind. So when you answer, when you say it's okay, No, I don't mind. And not at all. You can use it like this. And what you said earlier, of course. This is okay. Sure. This is okay, too. You can't say yes. So Emily said, Of course. Sit down. Sit down here? Of course. Sit down here. Should I say sit down here? Don't you think I should say it more simply? Simply? Don't you think I should say it more simply? In Korean, Of course, do it. Yes, like that. Like that. But how do you say it in English? Go ahead. Ah, go ahead. Go ahead. Because in English, people don't like repetition, not just in Korea. So, It's not just go forward. Just proceed. Do whatever you want. Go ahead. Go ahead. Sure, go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead. So, sit down here is a bit... Do you have to say it so clearly? You might think like that. Right. I see. So, if you want to say it like this, Go ahead. Feel free. Of course, go ahead. Thank you. How about today? How about today? Yeah. How about today? But if you say how about today, it's a bit awkward. How about today? It feels like this. Ah, yesterday was really... really tiring. Yesterday was really bad. Then, How about today? Then, how about today? It becomes like this. In that context, it's how about today. Just, How was your day today? Then, How about today? How is it going? Right. How is it going? Exactly. How is it going? How is it going? But what if you put day here? Day? Day. How is it going? How is your day going? Like this. How does it... How does day... How... does... the day go? Then, what happens is, I just used the present tense. Yes. So, How is your day? It's a bit more... How is your day going? How does your day normally go? It's like this. How does your day normally go? How does your day normally go? It's like this. How did... How did the day go? Just use the present tense. Just use the present tense. What? The present tense. In the present tense. How is... the day going? How's the day going? But here, More than more. How's your day going? How's your day going? How's your day going? How's your day going? But, You can just say, How's your day? You can also say, How's your day going? You can also say, How's it going? You can also say, How are you doing? How are you doing? There are various expressions. To say hello. Earlier, How about today? It's like, Yesterday, I was tired. Today, How are you? It's like asking this. But, To say hello, How is it going? This is the most... That's right. It's normal. That's right. Because, I didn't say how about. How about you? You can say that. How about you? That's right. How do you think? That's right. In some cases, How about this? That's right. So, How about today? You can say, How about today? You can say, How about today? That's right. So, Emily said, It wasn't bad. Not bad. Not bad. Thank you. Thank you. That's right. So, How are you? How are you? That's right. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That's right. Thank you. How about you? How about you? How about you? That's right. How about you? How about you? That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. ",

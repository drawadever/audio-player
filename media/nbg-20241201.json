snuffy nose so I went to the pharmacy I got some pills some pills for my snuffy nose so I took a medicine his stomach I said I said it before and his stomach medicine yeah it can be it can make me sleepy a little but I have to I have to take it take the pill yeah so his snuffy nose was so his snuffy nose was improved a little yeah that's good yeah that's good and you watched you said you watched the home sweet home video uh hot in the during the hard week the gd the big bang was surprised surprising to me very good very nice wow wonderful gd was like gd is good singer marvelous yeah it's true it in the part uh in the front part of home sweet home the melody um wow it's so impressive to me was it yeah it's so refreshing and nostalgic nostalgic sense nostalgia nostalgia yeah home sweet home is it the home sweet home do you remember the lyrics lyrics uh uh I'm sorry I couldn't catch well it's so fast but it's a melody is very good the the lyric goes like this in the how do I say yeah of course this song when this song started with melody the gd so the yeah ceiling oh ceiling ceiling we above the melody was started oh gd closed his eyes only uh a moment and then he worked to front of the stage oh this is so you got goosebumps oh goosebumps wow it's gorgeous so i i i saw you you said you like the gd yeah very much yeah so i i'm watching it to you basically all day these days yeah not not the same video but then like old old video some of these old old videos old video yeah like back in 2017 or 16 um i often saw the movie of this movie often this video this video yeah four or five times a day four or five times a day wow that's intense and you don't know the lyric at all yeah it's so fast i i need to understand the lyrics in the front of the song you said in the like this you said uh-huh she must go on yeah she must go on have um i'm feeling like i've never left i understand i understood in front of them so a little um and taeyang and taesung they came together yeah it's very yeah after gd rap him yeah he introduced the taeyang like this like this motion wow it's goosebumps yeah it's a backstage is that uh-huh the song rise up right you know the town is wow it was very cool very cool cool yeah cool how about you how about you feeling um at first how you feel is it yeah a little bit at first i thought my first impression was like the song is good the song is good but i didn't really how do i say felt uh felt the vibe because i felt like his choreography his his dancing yeah he's dancing very good but it's not like what it used to be no you don't know that it's his choreography is bad fantastic is taeyang taesung are you are you an expert i saw the dancer opinions that's all no you can't you can't just uh i saw the movie of dance so you have to say from your own opinion like you can't just call it so it's famous dancer i know but i i j-hope you know i don't know but i think he he was he was commenting on gd's dancing on yeah on another video it's like dance performance yeah yeah but i'm talking about his performance on mama oh but it's fantastic i think so it's a character character characteristic it is it is but he used to be characteristic and at and skillful at the same time small action and minimal change of action makes the big change because it difference from another song taeyang motion just a little action of gd it makes the much of much change i know what you mean yeah i just used to feel it uh like when when he was performing years ago but not i'm not quite feeling it right now he's so old i know so i understand i don't know i understand and then i don't think enough for him to show show his thought and his vibe of course i but i don't think it's just about his age because taeyang's dance is perfect like beyond perfect so i feel like because gd took a rest for seven years so it's understandable that he wouldn't have practiced much so his dancing skill must have deteriorated a little no no no gd is nah he's all he's a human he took a rest for seven years it's natural for him he can uh dance like taeyang and daesung but he didn't because his unique style yeah because before he didn't dance like him because he didn't want to because he had his own unique style but this time i felt like he didn't dance like taeyang because he couldn't you know and there's did you watch did you watch his good behind the scene video i don't know there is this video and uh he he talks about how it is so hard for him hard for him to follow the choreography nowadays he he will say i would memorize that like dance moves for in like five minutes or something before but now if i do it over and over again i still don't get it that's how i say so you know he admitted himself and i kind of see it too but he's still cool i'm not i'm not saying that he lost everything i'm just saying he lost a little bit it's not like as it used to be well i like it i like it i like him a lot too i like it yeah that's motion that's emotion it's a rhythm but oh that's it's so cool yeah and i like his song he enjoy he enjoy uh he's enjoying the rhythm like small action um but small action despite the small action he can express his emotion and vibe you know um dancing is good but um it doesn't have a soul yeah not so i'm but it's i like it i like him he's good dancer is he he had his dancer had dancing has i know what control precise and disciplined precise and disciplined for control sharp and control i like it he's nice yeah yeah me too oh gd is best gd is the best okay let's talk about today's today's topic his song and his stage you're not done yet he healed me yeah oh healing to me did you cry yeah cry yeah i'm crying yeah oh no this didn't you see the comments there are a lot of people cried watching the video really yeah really i'm not i'm not the level to uh that level i'm not just just like it just enjoy it cry try try it next time um should i have tried i should i have tried it should i try i should i should i have tried not much maybe you should have uh-huh okay anyways yeah moving on so did you see we were talking about yeah the architecture right yeah so is there a building that you visited that left a deep impression on you what made it special and do you know anything about the architect behind it like the buildings that you saw in person when i have an interest in building architect you're talking talking like korean you're talking english like it's korean these days very very recently days recent days recently recently i i had an interest in the in architect very recently so i didn't i didn't have interest in architecture in the past so i couldn't i cannot answer about it exactly but i can i i can imagine just imagine um my favorite building is longshan chapel longshan chapel did you see this movie this video yeah yeah of course i saw it but it's a bit blur blurry because i saw it like three weeks ago it's a bit blurry oh this chapel is church this building has unique curved and curved line and mysterious atmosphere because this building architect has a uh a thick thick wall thick thick wall thick yeah in one side this church is built on old church um the old church is not uh destroyed at all or partially destroyed and the new church longshan chapel made on uh incorporated with this old church this church has i said that thick wall and which has or several windows in out in the outer surface several windows each windows has uh have uh have has uh various size of window and various color various size and size color shape and shape of glasses outer surface in the outer surface like blue red and yellow you know like stained glass stained glass yeah the color did you see the picasso green picasso picture like just a simple design it's a yellow blue green like mondrian mondrian yeah mondrian mondrian color i know mondrian yeah thank god for that yeah so this church this architect control can control the sunlight entering in the inner space like by according to sun's height so is when sun is above above uh upping up the sunlight entering entered the church by uh angle of window because thick wall and outer window the penetrating angle is different right yeah so according to some height the amplitude the entering the right is controlled is various different from the so the higher the sun is the less the light come uh comes in to the building rest the less light comes into the building so the high the sun is yeah the less the sunlight comes into the building last less less sunlight oh less yeah i think so but it's a in the day the sun is going up and up higher the sunlight can penetrate the windows can penetrate and you know atmosphere is can uh atmosphere can change with the time color and amount of light is different from the from a different with the sun height so this this can make the mysterious atmosphere in the church so people like it people like it um so yeah so lucoro vizier is a 20th 20th century architect very famous architect he made the five elements of architect modern architect in the his early age early year early stage of architect he liked the machine and mass production because machine is always right right it's accurate and can make the people more happy and live in the city building uh but he was his he was changed in the rate a rate year of architect like a long time chopper in the early stage he likes the angle angular building or large for mass production industrial industrial age but his mind's changing he likes he liked the curved line and actually he liked the nature in the late stage so he made the building architect incorporated to nature um fused with nature fused with nature in his late age was made in his late age late years so this is masterpiece of church in the world lucoro vizier's lucoro vizier's representative building i see so where is it where is it spain i don't know in spain i don't know exactly i don't know exactly maybe you want to visit one day maybe you want to visit one day yeah yeah you gotta know where where it where it is yes yeah i want i want to visit visit visit visit visit one day yeah yeah maybe someday i wanna go to europe europe yeah europe europe what did i say? europe what did i say? europe europe europe europe europe europe for visiting many architect in the europe europe europe yeah maybe someday yeah they have a lot of nice architecture yeah this church also has engineering system like a some water draining system in the cell yeah that is also an important part on the roof yeah yeah so it's very famous it is very famous church so another architect imitate okay okay so you talked about um quite a traditional architecture yeah so then what is the most popular architectural style in your city which is seoul",

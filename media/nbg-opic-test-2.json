    "text": "Okay, the topic is, do you like to go to bar? Bar? Bar. Yeah. Oh, do you like to? Okay, then we can do this question. So, I'd like to know about the bar you often go to. Where is your favorite bar? What does it look like? Please describe everything about that bar in detail. Yeah, you know, it's a little bit difficult question. I feel a little embarrassed. I like the bar where the chicken is served in bar. I enjoy eating chicken with alcohol, beer. Chimaek? Yeah, Chimaek. After work, I usually go there with my colleague to celebrate finishing job. At that time, after first meeting at bar, like, you know, Samgyeopsal? After eating pork, there is a second meeting in chicken bar. The chicken is very delicious. It's salted with pepper. It's a little spicy and a little sweet. I eat chicken with sauce, deli sauce, mustard sauce. With beer, it's a very cool time for me. There is a small size shop, small bar. There are four or five tables. It's always filled with people in every table, all tables. We order by using tab. We use button to order the menu. We always, first time, mix the soju with beer like Chimaek in Europe. I like Chimaek. Yeah, Chimaek is good. It's not sour and a little cool because of beer. They have characterized the glasses, like iced glasses. They made it by the glass in the fridge. And people order the iced glasses, just pouring out, they pour the beer at the glasses. It's very cool. Drink it, drink it. It's very cold and a little sour. It's good to me. That's good. It sounds refreshing. Yeah. That's all. Thank you. You're welcome.",

    "text": "I think motivation is important, so I changed my room a little. I have one room, just one room, but I have a desk and chair, my bed. So, actually, in the past, I read a book in the bed, but now I want to read a book in the desk, on the chair. And my desk, there were many things, a book or a glass, a cup, and cosmetics. Cosmetics? Oh, like skincare products? Yeah, and tissue, and so on. But I cleaned my desk, just there I placed the book, only book. So, when I sit on a chair, I read a book. That's good. So you feel like you're more concentrated when reading books? I'm sorry? Do you think you're more concentrated now? Yeah, I'm concentrated. That's good. And what other things does this book talk about? For example, in Fundamentals, chapter 1, the surprising power of atomic habits. Do you have anything that you remember by chapters? I don't remember that, it's a very long time ago. No, it's not. What about this one? How to build better habits in 4 simple steps? Do you remember the 4 simple steps? I forgot about this, 4 simple steps. I think there were motivation and crave. Oh, right, here. Yeah, craving and response, reward. Can you explain this more, so that I can understand? I can't explain it accurately, exactly, but I want to try. The Q is, I think, motivation and craving. Craving means trying to do something. Craving? Reward? Why? I'm not understanding it. Why are you doubting me? I'm not understanding it. I'm not sure I'm understanding you. Me too. Yeah. What is craving? Yeah. What is craving? You don't know what craving is? I forgot this. What? What is craving? So you didn't understand when you read this? You didn't understand it while you were reading this? I forgot craving. Craving? Craving, craving. Craving. Wanting to do something. Yeah, wanting to do something. So we have a motivation, and we have to crave for it. And we can get a result, and we can respond to that. And we can reward ourselves. Reward to ourselves. So how does this work in real life? Can you give me a real life example? How it works? Not exactly. But it affects my life already. I want you to give me some examples so that I can better understand the concept. Example? Example? For example, I think always I said about article, it's paper. So first step, the cue, I want to study about something like my patient and surgical technique. So I have to study about that. Examine the patient characteristics and my surgical technique. So I want to know if my surgical technique is good or bad. I want to know about it. The cue, this is motivation for my thinking and my demand. So next, craving. Craving. I don't understand craving. So I think this graph is about creating habits, right? So you have to have specific habits that you want to create. So in your example, what is the exact habit that you're trying to build? Do you want to build a habit to study about your patients every morning when you go to work? What kind of habit that you're trying to build? Habit? It has to be about habit that you're trying to make or trying to break. I made a habit like reading a paper related to my topic. Every day, a paper for every day. One paper a day? Every day? In the morning or at night? Not determining the time, but when I think about it, I want to try to read a paper. Exactly, that is cue, right? Cue is something that reminds you of the habit that you have to do it. For example, if you decide that you want to build a habit to read an article every day, then you have to put an article where you can easily see it. For example, before you go back home, you might put an article that you want to read the next day. So that when you come to work the next day, you see the article. I try to read an article every day. That is a cue. It reminds you of the habit. Very specific. Of course, and it has to be easily seen. So that is a cue. Or it can be a post-it that you put on the side of your monitor to read an article every day. It is a cue. Oh yeah, I have to read an article every day. So that is a cue. And craving is you have to make it desirable. It has to make it easy. So if you want to read an article every day, then you have to minimize the step to read the article. For example, if you have to log in to your notebook and then open the site to search, open the search engine to find the paper, and then you have to search it, and then you open it, and then you have to authorize it, and everything is so difficult and it demotivates you. So craving is to minimize the steps so that it is so easy to read an article. Just one click away. So that maybe you can just pop it up in your notebook like this. It is easy. You don't have to search every time. It is right there on the monitor. So you can just read it like this. Or maybe if your purpose is just to gain a better knowledge, then it doesn't really have to be an article. Maybe you are a type of person who prefers video than letters. Maybe I tend to get sleepy when I read letters. But I am better concentrated when I see YouTube videos. Then maybe you want to just find the informational YouTube videos that you want to watch every day. Then it will make it more desirable. Not desirable. For you, but for someone who is more interested in watching videos. It is going to be more desirable for them. So it is an example, right? So that is craving. It has to be more easy, and more desirable, and more interesting. You have to make it like that. Does it make sense? Are you angry? No. No, I am trying to make a point. Your voice is very high. No, I am trying to make a point. Is it? Loud. Are you scared? Yeah, a little. It is okay. I am sorry. I forgot about this. Ah, you forgot about this. And response. Response. Response. I am not sure what response was actually. Response. What was it about? Let me see. Finally, response delivers a reward. Ah, third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform. Which takes the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs, whether it depends on how motivated you are, and how much friction... Response is a practice, I think. What you actually do. Yeah, right. Yeah, so actually doing it, response. And finally is a reward, right? Yeah. Yeah, so reward is about... After you are doing it, it has to be some kind of reward. So that next time you won't do it again. Yeah, right. Yeah, so this is how it works. So this is how... This is the way to make it easier to build a habit, right? So you have to make... So we follow the four steps to make a good habit. Yeah, so you have to make the cue... Always. Yeah, you have to make a cue very visible. Visible. Visible. Specific. Specific and visible. You can see it right there. You can see it everywhere. So like, it can be reminded of the habit. In craving, it has to be easy to do it. It has to be desirable to do it. And after doing it, it has to be visible. After doing it, it has to be satisfied. Satisfied. You have to feel satisfied after doing it. I can buy something to myself. Yeah, as a present. Or, you know, drinking something delicious. Or like, you're trying to... I deserve it. Yeah, exactly. How about you? You follow four steps every time? I think I do these two steps. Two steps? Usually. Usually. Yeah, so what I do in the morning, because I have a very hard time waking up. So when I wake up, I want to just eat something and then take the pill right away. Take a pill? Take the ADHD pill right away. Every morning. That's what I want to do. In the empty stomach? No, no, no. That's why I want to eat. That's why I want to eat right after I wake up. After eating breakfast? Yeah. And then you take a pill. So the habit that I'm trying to build is to eat something and have a pill right after I wake up. So what I did for the last few days is to set a bowl and a milk bottle and cereal and a spoon on my desk. Your desk? Yeah. And my pill. I think it's not good. And my pill on my desk. So when I wake up, I just go to my desk and eat the cereal and have a pill right away. He said, this guy, James Clear, said about that, it's one action in one place. Yeah, yeah, he said that. He said that. But then I think it has to be always, it can be flexible. As long as it works for you. So when you wake up in the morning, you can get a cereal readily? Yeah. For real? Yeah, because it's such a hassle to wake up and go to the kitchen and prepare everything to eat it. You're ready to get a cereal last night? You're ready? Yeah, last night before I go to sleep. I prepare everything on my desk. But is it okay? It's okay. Just overnight is fine. No. Just overnight is fine. Because I finish milk bottle in like three to four days. And then except for the time that is outside on my desk, it's always in the fridge. So it's fine. It doesn't go bad. I'm not worried about that. Yeah. So yeah, that's the thing that I'm doing. It's easily visible right after I wake up. So to take a pill. Yeah, it's right there. It's right there in front of my eyes on my desk. So I can just go there and eat it. That is a cue. And it's easier, right? But I think you are very normal. Not ADHD. I'm not. I'm so... I think you seem to believe your diagnosis. I think I don't know your symptoms like ADHD. You are very normal. Looks normal. Natural. Not ADHD. So you don't need to worry about that. That's because you only see when I'm productive. When I'm working right here. That's the only side of me that you see, right? Or get something. You are very productive. Yeah. You only see when I'm here and teaching you something. So that's why you think I'm not ADHD. This is you. This is you. You are productive. And in your home, this is you. That is you. You are natural at home. So... Of course, you are a teacher at home. I think that's more natural than ADHD. What do you mean? Not ADHD. You don't have to be productive at home. Even if you are lazy. Even if you go back and forth. That's just... You are a teacher. I don't think it's because of ADHD. So... I have a lot more symptoms that I haven't talked to you about. That I have had for a long time since I was a little kid. You had a lot of... Symptoms? A lot of... A lot of talk to anyone? No. I've had a lot of symptoms since I was a kid. ADHD symptoms. Can you explain it? First of all, When I was a kid, I think I told you this. I had a lot of MIA symptoms. Me too. Yeah. Okay. I had a lot of MIA symptoms. And when I was a kid, It was hard for me to go to school or keep track of time. So... I was late for school a lot. I was absent from school a lot. And... There was a time like that. My aunt just saw me on the street. I was just playing in the playground. When I was in elementary school. So what are you doing here? What are you doing if you don't go to school? I'm just playing here. Aren't you going to school? Why? Do I have to go? She was like this. It's been a while since I went to school. I was playing in front of her. I think it's good. Anyways, You're a dreamer. Anyway, that happened. I couldn't go to school properly. I couldn't do my homework. I couldn't take care of my trust. I couldn't do these things all the time. So I always stayed at school. I wrote a self-reflection letter. I wrote a letter of apology. I didn't do these things. But I didn't do it because I was rebellious to my teachers. I didn't do what I forgot all the time. Because I'm clumsy. And if I do something, I lose things all the time. Cell phone. Cell phone. My dad bought me a cell phone when I was in the third grade of elementary school. I lost my cell phone about four times from then to middle school. And since then, my dad hasn't bought me a cell phone. Yeah, I heard about that. So it's been a long time since I didn't have a cell phone. But my friends always had a hard time contacting me. I'm fine. So I always lose my cell phone or something important. And... It's so hard to keep deadlines. Okay, okay. I heard about that many things. I think... You think about that. It's good. It's not good. But I think it's good. Not bad. And there's another thing. ADHD is also impulsive. You know that, right? Actually, I didn't see ADHD patients. But I heard about it. ADHD patients are very confusing. It's confusing. One of the biggest symptoms of ADHD I hear is... carelessness and impulsiveness. Impulsive and uncareful? Yes, so... Carelessness and impulsiveness are the biggest symptoms. But the reason why it happens is... I heard about that. I have it. I have them. Impulsive and uncareful? Uncareful? Uncareful? But it's like... Yeah? It's like... When I become an adult, I still have impulsiveness. When I become an adult, carelessness disappears. One of the characteristics of ADHD is that I still have impulsiveness. So how I do it is... When I was in Australia, it was a few years ago. What happened was... I was waiting at the train station. If you miss the train, you have to take the opposite train. What if I miss the train? If you miss the train, you have to take the opposite train. You have to go back. Is that so? Have you ever missed the station? If I miss the train, I just have to wait for the next train. No, if you miss the station... If you miss the station... If you miss the station... If you miss the station... You didn't miss the train. You missed the station. You missed the station. You missed the station. If you miss the station, you have to take the opposite train. Then you have to go back. But I didn't look like a person. And it was dark. So you just ran. I just ran. Crossed the line? I just ran. That's possible. Then the police came and chased me. Then the police came and chased me. Did you try to commit suicide? No, I didn't. No, I didn't. I had to pay a lot of fines. I had to pay a lot of fines. It was very dangerous. And there was a big power outage. And there was a big power outage. If you step on it, you could be electrocuted. It was dangerous. You should never go there. But you didn't know about that. I didn't know about that. Anyone can try to do it. But no one does it. But no one does it. But in the dark, no one sees me. And around me, no one is there. I can try it. But think about it. But it's a long distance. But think about it. There's a screen door in the subway. You can't do it even if you want to. But you passed that door without a screen door. There is no one. I can try it. But there's almost no one. No one would do it. Not open. No one would do it. You might die or get electrocuted. You can't do it. But in the dark, I almost died from it. In the dark, I almost died from it. I think it's ADHD. I think it's ADHD. I had a feeling that I was dying. But you didn't know it. I don't usually do it even if I don't know. It's curious. I don't usually do it. And there was another thing. It's annoying. I was driving. I got a driver's license. I didn't practice driving at all. I went to Australia. I spent a year there. I was driving without any driving experience. I grabbed a steering wheel. I started driving. I was climbing a mountain. I was traveling alone. I was driving alone. I was climbing a mountain. The scenery looked good. I stopped and looked at the scenery. I got in the car and started driving again. I didn't turn on the engine. Did I just go for a drive? The car just went like this. But the engine wasn't on. You were alone? Yes. I was alone. The steering wheel didn't move. The brakes didn't work either. Because the engine wasn't on. I kept driving and hit a black wall. It was dangerous. If it was a cliff, I would have died. I didn't contact anyone. I didn't contact anyone. You were so lucky. I didn't contact anyone. It could have been a dangerous situation. There was a situation like that. I was driving on the highway. I thought I saw something wrong. I thought I saw a truck coming in the wrong way. I was driving on the highway. The car turned around. There was smoke on the floor. I stopped on the highway like that. Do you think it's an ADHD symptom? Yes. Because... No. No. It's just a driving mistake. It's a driving mistake. It's a driving mistake. I don't have much driving experience. If I don't have much driving experience, I turn people around. No. I'm afraid to drive. I say, I'm going somewhere today. I talk like this. No. I practice driving hard. I usually do. No. I was alone. I tried to drive by myself. I think I feel embarrassed. I'm embarrassed to talk about it. This is my first time driving. I'm worried about it. Be careful. Can you encourage me? Encourage me? No. Just... I think alone. Thinking about it. Just try. Try to drive alone. Just by myself. You're so normal. People are surprised when I say this. Usually. I don't have much driving experience. I bought a car and started driving. Do you know how many times I made a mistake? Me. Don't compare me to Byung-gu. I made a mistake about my car. 10 times. 10 times. I had an accident 10 times. Do you believe it? What is an accident? Is it a death? Yes. One time. Maybe. You have a long driving experience. In the first time. In the beginning. In the beginning? Yes. Because I'm not good at driving. I made a mistake while parking. I almost had an accident while driving. I almost died on the highway. There are a lot of things like that. You go through it in the beginning. That's why they tell you to buy a used car. It doesn't matter if it's broken. That's right. I've been doing a lot of dangerous things since I was young. I've been hurt a lot. I broke my collarbone. Actually, I... I saw you. When I saw you for the first time. You look healthy. Healthy and fun. It's nice. Nowadays, you look thin. Be careful of your health. Your look. I don't want to say. Don't worry about it. I think you are not an ADHD patient. But this guy... It's just a diagnosis. Every guy has a little ADHD. Me too. I'm very impulsive. What was it? I'm impulsive. Carelessness? Yes, carelessness. When I work, During surgery, I can make a mistake.",

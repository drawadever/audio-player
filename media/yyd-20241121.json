    "text": "That's right. Yes, good. Now we are doing some catching up, right? Yes. I just went to the computer school and practiced my Photoshop. Ah, Photoshop skills? Yes. How do you enjoy it? How do you find it? Do you like learning Photoshop? Yes, it's really funny, but it's so complicated for me because my major is not about design. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Then what was your motivation to learn Photoshop? Because I want to find a job about brand marketing. It's really necessary skill or it's really necessary currently because most people, they can do a lot of things about computer skills. It will help me to find a job easier. Right, right. Makes sense. Makes sense. So if you start working as a brand marketer, then do you also imagine designing things by yourself? Yes, maybe sometimes I have to imagine the design by myself. Just in case. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think if you find designing fun, then you can definitely do it because I feel like, you know, it's not like only designers have to design. I feel like as long as you're good at it and you know how to use the tools, anyone can be a designer. That's what I think. Yes. Anyways, so I think we can start with the prompts. So can you tell me about a time when starting? Before we go into the conversation, I want you to, when you answer the questions, I want you to give an answer for at least like one or two minutes. Okay. Yeah. So the first one, can you tell me about a time when starting was really tough? Every time. Every time. I think the most tough time about starting, maybe it's when I study every day, but not study too hard. But at least I studied every day. When I take the exam or do something, the end of the consequence. Oh, the consequence? Yeah, the consequence. It's not good enough than my expectation. Expectation? Expectation. In that time, I think study is meaningless for me. Even if I didn't study hard. Right. Like this time, after the TOEIC exam, right? Yeah. Yeah, I can imagine. And I'm also curious about your experience studying in China. How things are different from Korea? It's similar with Korea education. Chinese people, they always take the exam for university. Yeah, same thing. Yeah, it's the most important thing for every student. But I think it's not a good way for education because we have to learn a lot of things that we don't like. And we just study for the university, not for ourselves. Most of people take the exam and they don't know what they want to do. Right, exactly. Yeah, I think it's same for Korea. But I feel like it would be much more intense in China because they have much more populations. So there has to be more competition, isn't it? Yes. Yes, but China is not good. Chinese also don't have a better situation than Korea of education. Because Chinese people are too many. So competition is also really... Excessive. Yeah, excessive. I see, I can imagine. Yes. Yeah, and then because you have to put so much time into studying, you don't have any time to explore yourself and figure out what you really want. Yes, yes. I can imagine. Then what about a time when studying was actually fun? I think when I study something I'm really interested in, that time is really, really fun for me. But I can't just study those things to support my life. Right, right. Can you give me some examples? Like the things that you learned that you were interested in? I'm really interested in music. Especially vocal. And I learned piano since I was an elementary student. Wow, then you must be really good at it. No. No? I think you're just being humble. Yes, I just can look at the music notes and play slowly. I see. Because I give up the learning from my middle school. Ah, right, right, right. Yeah, I think it's very common for Koreans to learn piano as well when we were young. So I remember I also learned how to play piano when I was in kindergarten and elementary school. But now the only things that I can play is, I don't know how to say it, but... And then... You know... I think it was Chopsticks something. Yeah, is it? Do you know the song? Maybe. Maybe? Maybe it's only in Korea. Anyways, there's only two songs that I can play. And I don't know how to read music notes as you do, so... I see. So you said vocal lesson and piano lesson. Yes. And then you said you stopped learning how to play piano when you were in middle school, right? Yes. Are you planning to, you know, pick it up again? Actually, I picked it up when I was in high school. But... High school, when I was a high school student... Study at school is more important than improving myself in another skills. Right. So I didn't get a lot of support or encouragement at that time. So I just studied it as an interest... Interested? As a hobby? Yes, as a hobby. I wanted to learn vocal and piano to go to the school, the university about music. Oh, I see. Yeah. But my dad, he always disagreed with me. He said my personality is not suit with the entertainment field. So he, yes, he just didn't support me to go to school. I see. He, yes, he just didn't support me too much. I see. I understand. But then, how about now? Now you became an adult and you don't have to care too much about your parents' opinion. So do you still imagine yourself being a musician in the future? If I have some opportunity in future, maybe I will try again. But now I just want to find a way to quickly make money. Right, right. That is actually very important. Yes. Yeah, makes sense. Okay, then what do you need to study to stay competitive with others? Actually, I really, really don't like competition. Me neither. Yes, I just want to be competitive with myself. Right, right, right. Then, with that said, you said you wanted to become a brand marketer. Yes. So then, what are the things that you have to study to better yourself as a brand marketer? I think maybe I have to... Because my major in university is not about marketing or business. So maybe I have to learn a lot of things about marketing. Marketing skills. And find a lot of cases to study the marketing strategy. Yes. I see. And you said you also learned how to use Photoshop. Yes. And also TOEIC. You're preparing for TOEIC exam. Yes. Because marketing, you have to have good communication skills as well. Yes. So I think being able to speak Chinese, English, and Korean will definitely help you. And give you the competitive edge, even though you don't like competition. Yes. Yes. So because you are multilingual, are you planning to work in foreign companies? I'm okay with even if it's Korean company or Chinese company or foreign company. If I'm interested in the field or my valuation, value. Value. Yes. I can prove my value. It doesn't matter what company it is. But I just hope the company is not in China. Right. Yes. You want to work in Korea, right? Yes, now I want to work in Korea. Future maybe another country. Just not China. Right. Why not China? Because I really love my country. But I don't like the social situation. Such as? Because Chinese people are too much. So the competition is really, really... Severe. Yes, severe. But you can't get the pay. You don't get paid properly. You get paid little. Yes, you can only get the low... If you are new... Oh my god. Hold on. It's okay. If you just come to the company as a new candidate, new employee, then you can just get very, very low... Income. Income. Right, right. Yes. I have stayed in Australia. And I have talked to Chinese people there. And then I can imagine... Because there was a guy who was working in Huawei. Who worked in Huawei. And he said the working load was very intense. He said he had to work... I don't even know how long hours. Like from... I don't know. Like 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. or something? Yes. So working hour was super long. And the payment was actually quite low. I don't know exactly how much. But it was actually... It was definitely lower than my expectation. Yes. Because it's one of the biggest companies in China, right? And in the world. Yes. So I can imagine how other companies would be. Because it was the biggest company. So maybe it would have the high standard compared to other companies in China. Yes, because it's one of the biggest companies in China. So other companies' situation would be even worse than theirs. Yes. So I can imagine. Yes. Interesting. But I feel like the reason why I want to live outside of Korea is kind of similar to yours. So I know exactly what you're saying. Yes. My Korean friend is same as you. She also wants to go outside of Korea. Where? She wants to go to Canada. I see. I think for Koreans, it's usually either Canada or Australia. Either. Either means either A or B, right? Either Australia or Canada. Yes. I see. Then if you work outside of Korea, what is the first country that you want to go to? I don't know. I don't know, but I think I will choose Europe. One of the countries of Europe. Right, because it's beautiful there, right? Yes, it's beautiful. And you can enjoy a lot of things about art, music. Makes sense. Moving on to the next prompt. What do you want to study to explore yourself and enjoy a richer life? What do I want to study for myself? It's kind of the opposite question to the previous one. This one, you need to study, right? But this one, it's about what you want to study. So it doesn't relate to your survival or high income. It's just about your enrichment. Actually, I want to study English. Right, right. Because I have many friends from another country. And I really like to make friends from different countries, different cultures. And so if I want to keep the... Effective? Effective. Effective conversation with them, I have to improve my English level. Right, right. Now, how are you communicating with them? If they can speak Korean, we just communicate in Korean. But if they can't speak Korean, we just speak English. But I have to always turn my translator on. Oh, right, right. Because otherwise, it gets a bit slow, right? The conversation can get a bit slow. Yes. I see. And usually, when they're from Western countries, like one of the European countries, or other Western countries in general, even though English is not their native language, they're already pretty good at English, right? Yes. So how are Chinese people speaking English in general? Their English speaking skills, how good are they, you think? Actually, I really, really don't like Chinese education for English, because they just teach English for exam. And the teacher's pronunciation is really, really, really bad. Same, same. Yeah. So I think, I don't know other city, how about other city and another city's people, but in my hometown, in my school, most of my classmates, they just can read English, or just remember a lot of vocabulary, but they can't talk with anyone in English, because they don't know how, they didn't have the practice, they didn't have a practice. They didn't practice enough. Yeah, they didn't practice enough. Most of them, yes, they can't speak in English, and they're afraid of speaking English. Right, right. Yeah, I think it's a common problem that all the East Asian countries share. Yes. Like Korea, China, and Japan. They're all having the same problems, I think. Yes. Yeah, when it comes to speaking English. Yes. Because we get judged a lot whenever we speak English, so I think it's natural for us to feel a bit nervous and anxious, because we feel like other people will judge us, and if we are bad at speaking English, they will judge that this person is not smart or something like that. Yes. Yeah, so I totally get that. Yes. But though, I feel like, I think growing up in East Asian countries, I feel like it is totally natural to suck at speaking English. As you said, there's like tons of reasons for us to not being able to speak English confidently. Yes. So, yeah, I feel like we still, at least we can be confident that we are bad at English, if that makes sense. Yes. Even if we are bad at English, we have to be confident. Yes. Because it's natural. Like, for us, it is hard, right? Yes. Yeah, and next prompt. So, what are the more fun things that get in your way of studying? What are the more fun things that get in your way? Get in your way means \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294. \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub294. Yes. More fun things? Yes. No, no. Get in your way of means \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub2e4. Oh, \ubc29\ud574. Yes. \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub2e4. What are the more fun things that get in your way? \ubc29\ud574\ud558\ub2e4. Yes. A lot of things can get in my way of studying, I think. The most thing getting in my way of studying. The biggest thing? The biggest thing. I think it's smartphone. Right. Yes. What do you usually do on smartphone? I just watch the TikTok. Or Xiaohongshu is like Chinese Instagram application. Yes. Oh, wow. Xiaohongshu? Yeah, Xiaohongshu. Xiaohongshu. Yeah. Interesting. So you spend a lot of time on Chinese SNS platforms like TikTok and Xiaohongshu. Yes. But I think it's not good for me now because Chinese people.",

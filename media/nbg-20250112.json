    "text": "Have you ever had a moment where you couldn't fully express your gratitude or when someone's thank you felt a bit empty to you? Or when someone's thank you felt a bit empty to you Have you ever had a moment where you couldn't fully express your gratitude or when someone's thank you felt a bit empty to you? He didn't want it. Didn't want it. So he rejected the present? No, no, no rejection. It's not reject. But he nearly want that gift. He didn't really... Didn't nearly want it. But he said thank you, but it's not good. It was not good. It didn't feel like he really meant it. He didn't really meant it. Nearly meant it. Mean it. He didn't really meant it. Yeah, didn't meant it. So I think always the important thing is that expensive thing. The more expensive, the better? Yeah. Oh, I see. So that present that you gave to your friend, it wasn't that expensive? Yeah. That was the problem because it wasn't expensive. Yeah, wasn't expensive. Expensive. But it was a thoughtful gift, right? Was it well-thought gift on your end? Not well-thought gift. No? It was cheap and not thoughtful gift? Yeah. What did you give to him? So I think I wanted to show my gift or my congratulations to him. So I gave the gift, but it was cheap and not well-thought thing. I just wanted to give my congratulations. But it's still sweet. But it's still sweet that you gave him the present, right? Because I feel like nowadays people are not doing that as much. Yeah. I think you do exchange gifts between boyfriends and girlfriends or with really close friends. But I feel like even with close friends, I barely do that anymore. Give the present? Yeah. We would meet up and have dinner. But no gift? Yeah, if I think about it, I think we do. Among close friends. Just you bought the dinner? No. No? No. I do exchange gifts with close friends. For example? For example? Yeah. I mean whatever they want. Before their birthday, they usually give us some list of things that they want. And we just choose the one that we want to give them. Oh, really? It usually costs around between $30 and $50. $30, $50. $30 to $50? Yeah. What kind of gift? Sometimes it's cosmetics or books. Books. Or... It's books. I think when the gift is a book, people... Don't appreciate it. Yeah, don't appreciate it. Was the gift the book? The gift that you gave him was a book? No, no book. But I had an experience. Which I gave the book to someone. But this guy didn't appreciate me. Right. Yeah. Right. I think... I think some people find it a little bit condescending. I'm sorry? Condescending means... It's like... It's condescending when you look down from above. Condescending? Condescending. It's called condescend. Because condescending. Yeah. Condescending is when you look down from above and try to teach someone. It's called condescending. It's when you look down. What it means? It's when you look down and try to teach someone. Condescending. Yeah. I think some people... Sometimes people find it a little bit condescending. When they are gifted with books. Condescending. Yeah. Because they may think the other person is saying that you should read more books. Or you know... I want you to know this or something like that. Obviously, it's a sweet gift. But I think some people may find it like that. It could be. Condescending. I agree that books are a little bit controversial gift. Controversial. Yeah. Makes sense. Then, next question. I think the best gift to me is cash. Really? Yeah. Really? Yeah. But it's very effortless. Effortless? Effortless. Effortless. Effortless. Effortless. Yeah. Yeah. Effortless. But... There's no time that this person... Yeah. I know. Not everyone does not want cash. But it's effortless. But it's easy and comfortable gift, I think. Yeah. It's just... 10,000... 100,000 won. I think it's proper to give the gift. I think it's more like an allowance than a gift. I don't think you should call that a gift. Just money? More like donation. Donation. Yeah. Yeah, like charity. Charity. Yeah. I don't think you should call that a gift. What about... What do you think about best gift? I think the best gift is... It's when you closely observe this person. And then... See that this person needs something. Maybe she uses this perfume a lot. And you saw it almost empty. Then you might give that perfume for a gift. And then it means that he really cares about her. So... When you give the gift to someone... Are they always satisfied with it? Not always. Not always? Not always. Yeah. But I don't... I mean, I never know if they're really satisfied with it or not. Because they always say they're satisfied, right? So... As far as I know... They were all satisfied with my gifts. But I can't really know. Yeah. Anyways. On the surface, they all looked happy. Yeah. What is the best gift for you? Money? Yeah. Jewelry. Jewelry? Yeah. Like gold. Necklace. Is it necklace? Necklace. Ring. Rings. To woman. But you're a man. I mean, I'm talking about what is the best gift for you. Me? Yeah. For you to receive. I didn't remember it. I don't remember. You didn't remember... Yeah. I don't remember. The gift that you really liked? Yeah. It's very long, long ago. That's okay. What if you can get a present tomorrow, in the future? What would be the best gift for you? I think... Just a book. It's about a poem. Poem? Poems? Yeah. Poem. Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Poems? Books? Books? Books? Books. Books? Books? Yeah, yeah. It's what you need... Books? Books? It takes a lot of... For deeper meaning, book? For deeper meaning, books? Shoes. I like running. Like sneakers? Yeah, not sneakers. Walk around. I like walking around. And running, so... I like shoes. And book. Or... Jewelry? Huh? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? No, no. I don't like jewelry. Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? Jewelry? I don't have any jewelry. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Then, what? Huh? Then, what? You're... You're trying to say something. Oh... Girlfriend? Girl... Yeah. You're so desperate. I'm just kidding. Good way to get a girlfriend. You can appear in none so long. I'm just kidding. Everyone says that. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. Next question. When was the last time you put deep thought into expressing specific gratitude to someone? And how did they react? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. How much thought are you endorsing? I think it's difficult to understand in that situation. I don't even know. I don't even know. I don't understand. It's difficult for me to really clearly understand. I don't understand. It's really difficult for me too. Like... I can feel it at first but... How many people are watching us? I'm watching everyone individually. Can you show me what they are saying? Probably like.. Deep thought. What is there? What is there? I don't know. There's that too. You introduced Breaking Bad. Best drama. To me. I see. What about the time that you gave someone a gift? I'm sorry? What about the time when you gave someone a gift? Time? Rather than you received a gift. When I received it? Not when you received it. How about when you gave it? Give what? The time when you gave someone a gift. When I gave it? Yes. I didn't express my gratitude. The gift that I gave? Oh, it's not. That's right. I made a mistake. I didn't express... No, no. It's my fault. You? No, it's very specific. No. It's... What do you call it? Life's best? Life's best drama? That kind of feeling. Oh, really? Yeah. I haven't seen the movie, the drama like that. Since I watched... What is it? Korean drama? English drama? Actually, I was going to recommend you another series. And I forgot. It's this one. Jjanggu? No. It's called Beef. Beef? Have you heard of it? Beef? No. No? Beef is a beef. But it also means... So when you say you have beef with someone, that means... You have a conflict with that person. You have a conflict. Struggle between them. And continue, continue. They didn't give up their purpose. Their beef. Their beef against each other. They didn't apologize to each other. And continue to struggle with each other, with them. And fighting and shot the gun. Right? Yeah. Oh, you watched it? Yeah, I saw it. When did you watch it? I think it can happen. Yeah, it can. It was an interesting series. Wasn't it? Yeah, so I enjoyed it. I see. When did you watch it? This movie, a little... It's chilling. Chilling. Thrilling. Thrilling. Thrilling. But on the other hand... On the other hand? On the other hand, I think it was funny. Yeah, it is funny. This drama ended up with reconciliation. Each other. They reconciled with each other. Reconciled, yeah. They gave up. And how they do it is very interesting, right? Yeah. They eat mushrooms and then they get hallucinated. And they start to feel that this person is me and I am this person. And then they feel like they all came from the same place. Like they are the same at the end of the day. And yeah, the process was interesting. Yeah, it was interesting. Yeah. Everywhere they went, they could meet each other and confront each other. And they fought. Fight? Fought? Fought. Fought again and again. And they wanted to kill each other. It's very thrilling and funny. They reconciled with each other. And then when... Because they were... The husband found them and then shot the gun to him. Shot the gun at him. And then I think... I think... He... He was... Vegetary? Vegetated. Vegetated. Yeah, he got vegetated. And he got hospitalized. And then I think the very last scene was him lying on the hospital bed. And her lying beside her hugging him or something. Wasn't it? I think it was the last scene. I forgot it. Yeah. That was finished. I think so. Last scene. Yeah, that's the last scene that I remember. Not happy ending. It is... Yeah, in the middle. Somewhere in the middle. It's not like totally bad ending but it's not very good either. So this drama shows that... Forgiveness is important. Each other. Every time. And I think it also talks about... Resolving the deep issue inside them. Deep issue inside them? Yeah, like deep... How do I say? Deep thoughts and emotions? Like emotional... Anger. Burden, anger. Anger, stress. Deep inside them, yeah. Because that's what caused all of this at the end of the day. Especially the woman. The woman. Very stressed. Yeah, everything about her life looks perfect on the outside. But it was all messed up inside of her. And it was the same for the guy as well. She got a conversion. She found a gun. In her house. So she used it. Used the gun. Shot the gun. Right. Yeah, so I think that she... She's repressing her nature. Violated nature and her anger. Too much. I think that's what caused all the drama. Yeah. She... She got occupational stress. Or... It's a little thing. She could be stressed with it. From environmental things. Many things. Just a small thing. Like... What should I say? It's like a traffic accident. Right. Sensitive. Very sensitive. Yeah, and I think it was very relatable to me. And then it also covers her childhood. And then how she was kind of neglected by her parents. Neglected by her parents. She wanted to succeed. Succeed? Success? She wanted to succeed. I think she was a businesswoman. Businesswoman, yeah. And she's already successful in the series. But she's not fulfilled. Not fulfilled. And I feel like it all comes from her... Insecurity rooted in her childhood. That she's not worthy of love. And she's not... She's never gonna be enough. Things like that. Yeah. Do you ever suffer from that kind of feelings? That kind of feelings? Yeah, I have. Me too. Constantly. I think it's natural. It's natural. Very natural. To some extent, it is. Yeah. Now, I have a position. But I... Sometimes I think about my position. It's not good. So... I saw the past in my life. So I regret it. And... If I went to the past, I could do another thing. I imagine sometimes. But the present, now, is important. So... The past is not changeable. I must focus on the present. I want to change my future. So I do more. I learn more about something. To grow my ability. What kind of things that you regret not doing in the past? I regret my specialty. I did say about it before to you. So you don't regret being a doctor, do you? No. Just surgery. Specialty. Just specialty. Surgery is physically difficult. Hard. Physically demanding. Yeah, demanding. So... I want to be comfortable. Easy to live. I see. So you regret becoming a surgical doctor? Yeah. What else? I'm a physiologist. Mediologist. And dermatologist. Or maybe plastic surgeon. They can have more free time in their life. And they can earn the money more at the same time. So it's all about money? No. No, no, no. It's not money. But it's time and free. I see. Yeah. I see you're really busy. So I know what you mean. We can enjoy the journey to another site or area. Country. Like this weekend. But I couldn't do that. Can't do it. Cannot do it. Can't do it. And next week, I have a duty on weekends. Dermatologist, plastic surgeon, another guy. They can go on a journey every weekend. Every time. Not every time, but it's more open compared to me. I see. So do you have to do weekend shifts? So it's not something you can choose? My shift? Yeah. Is it? So it's not an option that you can choose not to do weekend shifts? Duty? Duty? Yeah, duty. Weekend duty? So you can't choose not to do weekend duty. So it's not an option. Not an option. It's compulsory? Just duty. Yeah. Duty. Mandatory. Mandatory. Yeah. I see. That must be frustrating. We have emergency. We also have emergency. The hospital needs us in emergency situation. We have to go there and we work every time. Every time. But is it always like this? Or is it especially this busy because of the strikes going on? Not because of strikes. It always. I see. It must be frustrating that you don't have the control of your time. Yeah. So I regret it. When I have time machine, I want to go back to past. Freshman year at university. And study again. Wow. But it must be tough to live with that big regret, isn't it? I think when I was a university student, I think this time... This time... What should I say? It was fun. You enjoyed the time? Yeah. I didn't feel responsible and I just had fun. But now I'm more responsible than now. I think I can study more. And I can choose. And I can choose another part. Except surgery. I see. But it still is a very meaningful job. Because it's directly related to saving people's lives, right? Unlike dermatology and plastic surgery. It's more like optional. It's not like people are going to die without getting the procedures, right? Yeah. Without procedures, people die. In terms of value, I think what you do is more valuable in that sense. I mean, money-wise, dermatology, whatever, they look more valuable. In this time and age, everything is translated into money. But then, at the end of the day, nothing is more important than lives. So you're saving lives, so it's very meaningful and valuable. Yeah, I know. I see.",

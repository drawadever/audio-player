    "text": "You know, Pythagoras' three supporters? Yeah. I'm going to say, who? Yeah. Who? I've never done this in English. Anyway. They already know about the A to B distance. And then they wanted to do the point. They wanted to do the A to C distance. And they established the standard point. For example, A and B and C. And then they wanted to do another point. The distance. And then they used the proportions of the A. It's difficult. Yeah. It's difficult to even explain in Korean. Yeah. Anyway. While they recovered their own assets, they discovered the principles of geometry. And then Pythagoras just summarized the principles of Egyptian geometry. Pythagoras, is that me? Yeah, I know. Pythagoras. Pythagoras. Pythagorean theorem. Theorem, yeah. Theorem, yeah. So, in a right angle triangle, the theorem of hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the scales of the other two sides. Yeah, I can understand. I can understand. I have learned. I remember, but I forgot. Yeah. One side, the distance is one. And then another side, the distance is two. And then the two lines are perpendicular. Perpendicular? 90 degrees. 90 degrees. Then another line's distance is root three. Yeah, I see. That is the Pythagorean theorem. Right, right. Now I remember. Yeah. So, root two is this one? Yeah, yeah. Hypotenuse? Yeah, hypotenuse. Oh, I see. So, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Yeah, anyways. So, that originated from as far back as Egypt. Yeah, yeah. So, they can make a pyramid. Because they are good at mathematics. So, they can measure height or sometimes something like distances. Because I think they have a religion. No, no. They believe after death. After death? After life? After life. After life. After life. So, the religion related with the arrow. Arrow. I'm going crazy. I keep forgetting. Astronomy. Yeah, astronomy. So, you know angel? Angel. Angel. A-N-G-E-L. Yeah, angle. Angle. A-N-G-L-E. Right, yeah. Similar. Yeah. Yeah. So, they examine the angel into the universe or sky. But when they observe the stars in the sky, there are a lot of angels in the sky. So, they examine. But when they look up the sky, it makes angle from the horizontal line. Right. Yeah, so, angel, angle. So, angle made from angels. Interesting. So, at that time, astronomy was very developed. Very exactly. Yeah, so, it's interesting that the environment is extreme and harsh. Yeah, yeah. They develop technology to overcome the challenges. Yeah, yeah. When they overcome their extreme environment, the technology always develops. Yeah, so, maybe that's why. So, maybe the fact that they develop so much is because they are so miserable. Yeah, right. Yeah. But they colonize different Greece and Rome, classical Rome. So, they make it derived. Yeah. Classical Greece and classical Rome. Still stolen? Still? Stolen? Yeah, maybe. Yeah. They stolen their technology to classical Greece or classical Rome. So, the Greece and Rome philosophies can write down the technology or philosophies from Egyptian or not in here. Euphrates and Tigris. But in the Middle Ages, the religion in Europe disobeyed. What? Anyway, remove the former philosophies and technologies of the world for 1,000 years. Yeah, that's what I heard. During the medieval ages in Europe, religions ruled all of the European philosophies or cultures and technologies. So, they could not develop anymore. But Middle East nations, such as Iran, mathematics and technology developed a lot. So, they imported the books about technology from Europe. And then, they copied and then edited the technology. So, Europe, Greece, Rome and their own technologies and mathematics. So, their mathematics was able to develop algorithms from Middle East nations at that time. And then, the U.S. Differentiation or different calculus? Calculus or integral calculus? It's called integration. So, the U.S. just called it calculus? Yes. It's called differentiation or integration. I see. Other than this, what else? Algorithm. What's wrong with me these days? It's all the same. Not calculus. It starts with R. I don't understand. It starts with R like an algorithm. Mathematics or integral calculus. Alexandrov? Algebra. Algebra? Calculus. I have never heard of it. I know. Algebra. It's driving me crazy. If you don't use it, it's not in your active memory. It's going to disappear. Oh, my gosh. That's what happens. I keep forgetting. That's because it's not in your active memory. I think it's normal. I know. But, it's so sad. Don't be sad. Algebra, algorithm, and R. It's an Arabic word. Right. So, there are a lot of mathematical terms in Arabic. I see. Interesting. Algebra is a kind of decart. It's a kind of decart. Right. He is a philosopher, but he was a mathematician. Mathematician. Mathematician. Right? Mathematician. Mathematician? Mathematician? Mathematician. Mathematician. Mathematician. He developed algebra. Algebra? Algebra means a kind of... I can't remember. Like in the weather? No, no, no. I don't even have that vocabulary in Korean. Topology. Topology. Topology? Yeah. I can't even understand reading the definition. Topology is a little bit difficult. Then, I'm not interested. I'm not interested. Yeah. Algebra and topology originate in the axis. Axis? Axis. Axis, right? Axis, yeah, right. Coordinate? Coordinate, yeah. Coordinate. I don't know. Yeah. If the current world were not... Hadn't existed? Yeah. Yeah. The rockets, astronauts cannot go to... Couldn't have. Couldn't have. Travel to the moon. Travel to the moon, yeah. Thank you. Couldn't have traveled to the moon and Mars. Right, right. Yeah, yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. I don't understand the grammar and the meaning. Yeah, and then that applies to just normal human like us as well. Yeah. Like people, usually people who are obsessed with success. Yeah. They're usually miserable. Yeah, right. You know what I mean? So, say this country. The developed country, they're actually miserable inside. Yeah. Always upset. When I speak English, I'm upset. Yeah. That's okay. Yeah. They have developed a good coordinate. I see. Yeah, so he was a... I think like back in the days, philosophers... So philosophers, they're usually like mathematician as well, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, right. Yeah, they were both always... But nowadays, they think it's totally different. Yeah. So philosophy is a part of art. Yeah. Liberal art. Yeah. And mathematician is part of, you know... Yeah. That is the problem in Korean education. European education, that is the same thing. Same course. Yeah, mathematics and then... Philosophy? Philosophy is the same thing. Is it? Yeah. Because the character was a philosopher and mathematician. And then back then, classic Greece and Rome, Plato was a philosopher and he was a mathematician. And Chagras is the same thing. Right. Chagras was a philosopher and he was a mathematician and he was a composer. Right, and artist too. Yeah, composer. They're usually all three of these things. Artist, philosopher, and mathematician. Yeah. He developed the... What? He discovered the... Plato? What? Wow! Really? Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Scale? Major scale, yeah. Major scale minus scale. Scale, scale, scale, scale. Musical scale. Scale. Plato? Pythagoras? Pythagoras discovered the major from the... Iron... The place making iron. Blacksmith's shop? Blacksmith's shop. Blacksmith's shop or horse? Blacksmith's shop, yeah. Blacksmith's shop is common, yeah. Yeah. So the blacksmith tapped the iron. The sound was different. So they realized the scale has a... Has a rule. From the thickness of the iron or size of the pottery or... Pottery? Yeah, pot. Pot? Yeah, pottery. Pottery. And then the height of the water into the pottery. Ah! Yeah, so they discovered the rule using mathematical theory. Observing the blacksmith's sounds or pottery sounds. So he made Doremi Pasolasito and then major scale and minor scale, Doremi Pasolasito, write something. It is a kind of mathematics. Right. I think I have heard that mathematician and music is similar in a lot of sense. That's called Hwasama. Hwasama. Yeah, so Renaissance and back then Byzantine music come from the mathematics. So mathematicians are composers in the medieval age. They had to compose the music using all kinds of mathematics rules because of the religion. So when we listen to medieval music, we are always bored. We are always bored because of same harmony or same... Hwaseong? Yeah, Hwaseong. Oh, harmony. Yeah, harmony. Same harmony. Let me see. Bach. Yeah, I think back in the days, mathematics, art, music and philosophy were all connected. Like all closely connected because it originated from the interest of the world. But now we all pretend like it's all very separate. Yeah, all separated. And we tend to focus on just one narrative at a time. So I call the Korean education system right there, Clipper education. Clipper education? Like clipper? Nail clipper? Nail clipper? Ah, clip... Did I forget again? Oh, cripple. Yeah, cripple. Right? Yeah. No, not cripple. Cripple. Cripple. Ah, cripple. Cripple. Ah, cripple. But this is very... It's a very derogatory term. Yeah, cripple. Ah, cripple. Yeah, right. Cripple. This is a very bad word. Yeah, right. That's why I used a bad word. Ah. So in Korean, it's called a cripple dictation. Ah. But I forgot that. Ah. Because in Europe, there's nothing. But as far as I know, it also exists in Australia. Because they separated arts, which is munka, and science, which is igua. But the boundary word... It's less strict. Yeah. Yeah, probably. Not strict like Korean. Right, right, right. But European education is considered the same area or same courses. And then we separate them from high school. Yeah. Yeah. When they tested for college, commonwealth countries tested A-level. Yeah, A-level. A-level. A-level. Yeah. A-level is college test exam. Ah. Yeah, so when they tested mathematics and higher... Higher degrees? Higher education? Mathematics. Advanced. Advanced. Advanced. Mathematics? Yeah, anyway. Advanced mathematics. When they tested mathematics and advanced mathematics, they can use the calculator. But we cannot. When they scored the test, they don't care about the answer, the procedure. If the students correct answer, the procedure, but the students cannot write the right answer, but the score is... Perfect score? Perfect score. I think that makes sense. They can get the perfect score. But our test is totally different. Procedure is not important. Only answer is important. Right. It is different. Because procedure is the kind of orchestra. They consider or they think to the test students can organize the mathematics theory or logic. Or students can understand to organize the mathematics system like orchestra. It is important. So they consider mathematics to music. But our education is totally different. Mathematics is mathematics. Music is music. So musicians cannot... Yeah, they don't know about mathematics. They can't really compose. And like you, artists cannot care about mathematics. Right. I didn't even need to study mathematics to go to college. When I teach my students, sometimes I explain the geometry. Geometry is mathematics. So I spoke out the root. Then every student looked down the table. They don't care about mathematics. They don't know. But in architecture, you kind of need it, right? I think it's not art. It's more science, isn't it? That's right. Actually... How should I say? Korean department of architecture is divided into two parts. First part is important thing is design. And the second part is engineering. Oh, I see. So the part with engineering is considered science. And the other one is considered art. Art and philosophy. Oh, I see. Actually, I'm into... I majored in architecture, but I'm into design. So I always think about art, philosophy, mathematics, and design. All kinds of things. I think it's stupid to divide them into two. I really hated the professors' teaching methods at that time. I didn't want to listen to their lecture.",

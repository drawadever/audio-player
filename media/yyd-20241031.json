    "text": "From the first question, do you often procrastinate and how has that changed from past to now? It's good that you give me an answer for about like two or three minutes, so just keep that in mind and give me the answer. Yes, I am a procrastinator. I am a really terrible procrastinator, but also I am a terrible procrastinator. I always meet the deadline for my assignment. You always struggle to meet the deadlines. Yes. I see. So how has that changed from the past to now? Not too many changes. I see. Do you have any vivid memory where you procrastinated and get you into trouble? Yes, I always struggle with my school assignment because of my procrastination. So I always pull an all-nighter because I have to finish my assignment until deadline. I see. Then I think you can relate to the next question as well. In the talk, the speaker gave examples like getting lost in Wikipedia articles or exploring Google Earth out of nowhere. So when your instant gratification monkey takes over, what do you usually end up doing? Instant gratification monkey takes the wheel. So when you have deadlines to meet, but you want to have some fun and you want to put off things until the last moment. So in that situation, what do you usually end up doing? It can be chatting with your friends or play video games or watching YouTube. It can be anything. I'm just asking what is the usual thing that you do in that situation? I really just lay on my bed and watch the TikTok and trying to not think about the deadline. Oh, I see. Then what kind of videos do you watch on TikTok? Some movie explanation. That's interesting one. So do you like watching movies? Not really. I prefer drama than movies. Oh, I see. But when you watch TikTok, you usually watch movie explanation videos. Yes, and some just... Just random? Yes. Not too many special. I see. Because things like short form videos, short form contents like Instagram Reels or YouTube Shorts, they're all random. You can't really choose what to watch next, right? Yes. It all works with algorithms, so you can't really have much control over it. Yes. Yeah, so you end up watching random things. I know what you mean. Yes. And next question. So there was this panic monster that speaker talked about. And I found the term really funny. So for me, it wakes up when I've wasted my whole day and it starts to get dark outside. So have you ever had a moment when your panic monster helped you get something impossible done in a short time? In my college, I have to make a video for my assignment, but it's a long video, about eight minutes. So I have to, I have to write the scenario, then, film, you have to film, film it, film the scenes. Yes. And film the scenes and edit, edit the videos. I did my, I did my videos only into two days. Only in two days? Yeah. Because you, you procrastinated until the last moment? Yes. Oh, wow. That's intense. And you managed to do it? Yes, I did. I did it and I get some, I get some good evolution, evolution, evaluation, evaluation, evaluation. From my pastor, but I think I can do better if I don't have procrastination. Yeah, for sure. Actually that's impressive. Yes. Because I have made some videos myself, and then it takes me forever to write like, uh, to say eight minutes long video. It usually takes me about at least a week. Yeah, so it is impressive. Yeah, maybe because I, when, when I procrastination, I always think about the idea how to, or make the, how to make the process going well. And most efficient? Yes. Just how, how, how to do it, uh, uh, step one, uh, like, uh, what should I do? Step by step? Uh, step one, step two, step three. So, uh, I always thinking about this and, uh, a little anxiety. Hmm. Ah, you don't get anxious so much? No. Oh, wow. I, I get, I, I get anxious every day. Ah, you get anxious for everything. Oh, okay. Yes. Then in that case, you should, you should have answered yes. Because in English, when your answer is positive, then you have to just say yes, regardless of the question. Right? Ah, yes. Oh, wow. That's impressive. Um, then, uh, there was another term from the talk, which was dark playground. Yeah. So it's that feeling of doing something fun, but not really enjoying it. Right. Yeah. And it's hard to get out of that zone. So do you have any tips to avoid getting stuck there, or if you're already there, to escape it? Um, I read, I was read some tips of how to avoid the situation. You can read it as avoid. Avoid. Avoid this situation, like, if I really, if I really struggle with how to get out of my dark playground, I just should doing the right thing for five minutes. Oh, yes. Then the five minutes is passed. Maybe I want to more. And then maybe one hour is passed. So I can overcome it, overcoming this. Oh, wow. Actually, that's a really good tip. Yes. Because you're giving yourself a mission that looks very easy, right? Because it's just for five minutes. I'm just going to do it for five minutes, and that's it. I'm going to go back to TikTok, and you kind of try to deceive your brain in a way, right? Yes. Yeah, I'm sure that'll work. I think that'll work even for me. That's a good tip. Yes. Any other tips? Or, how about the tips that, tips to avoid getting stuck there in the first place? So the tip that you gave me was how to get out of that dark playground when you're already there. But is there any tips that not to getting stuck in there, in dark playground in the first place? Actually, most of the dark playground is because the mobile phone. Right. So if I don't want to go into the dark playground, I should have to turn my phone off or just put my phone far from me. Yeah, far away from you. Far away from me. So I can try to focus on what I should do to do. Right, right. Yeah, I think that is for sure very efficient, but also very hard to do, right? Yes. Yeah, people nowadays, they get easily anxious without their phone in their hands. Yes. Because you can virtually do anything from phone, talking to people. And what if you get important message from people, you know, while you're away from your phone? And all of that, you know, makes you feel anxious, right? Yes. I see. And next question is, yeah, the talk mentioned how delaying long-term goals can be a big problem. So do you have any long-term goals you're putting off? And how do you plan to overcome this? I have a lot of long-term goals I'm still putting off. Like, before I start to looking for a job, I have to complete my resume and my self-introduction. Self-introduction? Self-introduction. But I put it off about two months. It's okay. I've done that. And I have too much overthinking about another thing. It's important, but it's not important. It's not the most important thing for now. So I went to the psychology. Oh, so you mean you talk to therapist? Yes. And she told me if I want to overcome my procrastination, maybe I just have to write a little things about myself every day. So after one week, maybe I can finish my self-introduction. Ah, so she's talked about setting off small goals first. Yes. Yeah, that looks achievable, easily achievable. Yes. I see. And how did that work? It actually worked, but not really good for my self-introduction for looking for a job. Yeah, because recruiter, they have specific things that they want to hear from you. And they don't always want the truth, right? Yes. Yeah. I get it. Yeah, I hate writing resume or CV, whatever. I hate it. So I understand. Yeah. And any other long-term goals that you're putting off? Besides looking for a job and writing a resume? Actually, I want to improve my English level from two years ago. Uh-huh. So two years ago, I just had two weeks time when I studied English five hours a day. Oh! Yes. I see. Yes, I also bought the book and I studied the vocabulary every day, but it's not very efficiently. It wasn't really efficient? Yeah, it wasn't really efficient because I have a lot of vocabulary I don't know. Oh! Yes, so after two weeks, I want to continue, so maybe when I familiarize with many vocabularies, I can study my English easier. For sure. Yes. But at that time, my friends told me, you shouldn't have to push yourself too much. You can relax sometimes. Is that friend Matthew? Matthew? Yeah, maybe he will say the same thing to me, but it wasn't Matthew. It wasn't what? It wasn't Matthew. Ah, it wasn't Matthew. I see. So I just, so I can relax, so I just take my phone and lay on my bed, and yes. So you listen to your friends' advice faithfully. Yes, but I really regret about the decision. Yeah, and I totally agree that your pronunciation is good, and your speaking is also good, but I think the only thing that you lack is the vocabulary. Yes. That's how I feel. Yes, but it's too hard for me because the vocabularies, they look familiar. Familiar? Familiar, but sometimes because they are verbs or different, the meaning is different. Right, they have different meanings. Yes, they have different meanings, so it's really hard to memorize and how to use this in the sentence. I think the key in improving language and improving your vocabulary is in repetition. I think as long as you see a certain word over and over again, you kind of get the gist, you kind of just naturally get the meaning, so I think the key is you always expose yourself to English. You keep hearing, you keep reading, you keep speaking, so I think that's the most efficient because in that way, you're going to stumble upon the vocabularies that you don't know over and over again, and at some point, you're just going to get it. Yes. Yeah, so I think that's the key, and I think you have the good environment where you have your friends that you can talk English with. Maybe not, because you guys talk to each other in Korean or English? So you would have a lot of foreign friends from university? Yes. So do you talk in Korean with them or in English? I talk with them in Korean. In Korean? Yes. Because you feel more comfortable in Korean, and they are more comfortable speaking in Korean? Yes, all my best friends are from another country. Maybe they just want me to feel comfortable, so yeah. Maybe, yeah, so I know then you can try with your existing friend to talk in English more than Korean, but that may be hard because you already have this relationship that's been going on, and it's going to be more natural for you guys to talk in Korean, because that's what you guys have always done, right? Yes. I see. You know, but you can always make new friends. And you also have to practice Korean as well, right? So, you know, existing friends, they're already good friends to practice Korean with, but maybe you need a new friend to practice English with. But that's my suggestion. And you have to make sure that you don't talk in Korean with them. Because once you get comfortable in speaking in Korean with them, then you're not going to get out of there, right? Yes, yes. Anyways, so the last question is, what is the biggest lesson that you learned from the talk, and how do you plan to apply it in your life? If there is. Apply in my life. What's the biggest lesson from the talk? Any talk, just... Just this talk, inside of this talk. You know, the part that you found most impressive or helpful for you. Yes. I think... I have a lot of biggest lesson I learned from the talk, from other people. Because the last two years, I revealed myself too much. You revealed yourself too much? Yes, I revealed my past, and why my personality is like this. So it's really, really... Overthinking years. Over the two years. And the most, the biggest lesson I learned from the talk is... When we say the talk, it's talking about the video. Because we say that talk is same as... \uac15\uc5f0. Ah, \uac15\uc5f0. \uac15\uc5f0. \uac15\uc5f0\uc5d0\uc11c something that was helpful to you. \uac11\uc790\uae30 \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \uc548 \ub098\ub124\uc694. \uadf8\ub798\uc694? \ub9de\ub294\ub370 \uac11\uc790\uae30 \uc0dd\uac01\uc774 \uc548 \ub098\ub124\uc694. That's okay. I think we talked about a lot of things already. So we don't really have to go through the last question anyways. If you practice a lot, I think you'll improve a lot. No? \uc601\uc5b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4e4\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc800\ub294 \uc6d0\ub798 \ubbf8\uad6d \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8\uc5d0 \uad00\uc2ec \ud558\ub098\ub3c4 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uace0, \uadf8\ub7ac\ub294\ub370 \uc694\uc998 \uacc4\uc18d \uc601\uc5b4\ub85c \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \ub4dc\ub77c\ub9c8\ub97c \uacc4\uc18d \uc774\ub807\uac8c \ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\uace0. \ubb50 \ubcf4\uace0 \uacc4\uc138\uc694?

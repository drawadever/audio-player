And then, it is helpful because when I have free time, I'm by myself, and I can enjoy the food, or listening to the music. So I can do everything totally, but when I have a meeting, or when I give a lecture, I think I turn into an extrovert. So I can give a lot of examples with my lecture, or consulting, and then I can immerse the situation with people. I don't know. That is my personal kit. I majored in architectural design, but I'm into pure art, and then I'm into philosophy. Music, too. How should I say it? I'm kind of being into a lot of things in the world. In other words, I have a curiosity on everything. So I think out of the box in the world, that's my pros, I think. Good. You did well. Did I? Yes. What did I say? I think so. You told me to relax my stomach, so I practiced that. How was it? You become extroverted, right? So even though your major is architectural design, sometimes when you're not working, you're also into fine art. Right, right. And you have a lot of curiosity. And you're interested in a lot of things about what's going on in the world and stuff like that. Can you be a bit everything? What I said? It was what you said in the last job, right? Yes. Wow. Yeah. It is hard for you. What you said. It is hard for you. Yeah? Was it? Yeah. Oh, that's good. I don't think so. Right. That's just my mouth. What? I have to relax my stomach again.

Okay. Okay. Okay. Please describe your house to me. What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? One more time. Okay. Please describe your house to me. What does it look like? How many rooms does it have? Yes. You know. You know. Actually, I'm really drawn to art. So, I'm kind of a collector with paintings, sculptures, and installations too. So, I like to make my house into a gallery. I like galleries. So, I have a lot of paintings and sculptures. Of course, some paintings are very famous. The paintings are made by famous painters. And then, some sculptures too. Take your time. Yeah. But the painting, what I like is that it's cheaper than others. The painting was made by, you know, I don't know her name right now. Ah, Kim Jung-sun. She died 10 years ago. But I like her paintings. But I don't have original paintings. But the paintings are for her. So, it is not expensive. Whenever I see the paintings, it makes me happy. Because the color and the paintings, the ground is very natural. Some ducks are in the paintings. And they are inside of the\u2026 I don't know the plant name. The Korean name is kaldae, whatever. Ah, right. And then, the color is green and yellow and pink. The colors are matched with my dining room. So, it gives my dining room more freshness. And then, my house is a kind of apartment. Three bedrooms and two bathrooms. And then, the master bedroom has a bathroom and closet. And make-up room. I like simple or\u2026 Or\u2026 Just give me a second. I like to make my room more comfortable. So, I always take care of my bed cover. Whatever. Bed cover or seat. So, the bed cover or seat cover color is always white. I use always white. Because it is clean. It feels to be clean. And when there is dark, I can't run to them. I don't know. Yeah, I know what you mean. Yeah. And then\u2026 Actually, I live in a complex city. But a house and a store. I don't know the name. So, I live higher than others. I live in 36th floor. So, the scenery through the window is amazing. I can see\u2026 I can see the\u2026 I don't know. You can see Han River? Yeah. I can see the buildings and mountains. And Lotte Tower. Everything. Right. And then sometimes I can see the birds flying in the sky. And then close to the Han River. Because\u2026 Like a\u2026 Pretty. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. It's clear. Sometimes you can, sometimes you can't. Yeah, maybe. But you know, it happens. It happens all the time. Maybe, just try to wrap it up a little bit. Wrap it up? Yeah, I can wrap it up. Wrap it up? Yeah. Actually, in summary\u2026 I have a house like a gallery and cafe. So, it is very comfortable.

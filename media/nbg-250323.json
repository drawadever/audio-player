    "text": "So, the instinct of foods encoded our brains from a long time ago, and so we can crave for junk food, like calorie-rich food, we usually want it because of supernormal stimuli. So in the food industry, they can use these supernormal stimuli to sell the foods to people. For example, a potato. Superficially, the potato has a crunch, but internally, it's very soft and wet. This combination stimulates the auto-sensation of people, so supernormal stimuli can affect our life, our habits. Makes sense. So now I understand what supernormal stimuli is. Yeah. Stimuli... This is... This and dopamine... So, during life, we have supernormal stimuli, so we can follow the supernormal stimuli unconsciously. And there is a hormone in the brain that is specific for stimulus. It's dopamine. We have a dopamine-driven feedback loop. In this loop, what is important is that we can feel the dopamine effect in the time of anticipation, not the reward time. For example, we can have dopamine in the brain when we anticipate Christmas Eve or Christmas gifts. Yeah. Like this. Christmas gift is not a large effect of dopamine. On Christmas Eve, we can feel the dopamine surge because the anticipation of dopamine is very big and very effective. Like strong? Yeah, strong. Thank you. So, anticipation of reward is important in our habit. We can apply the dopamine feedback loop to the habit. So... This book, Conclusively, shows the temptation bundling using dopamine feedback loop. For example, we want something... For example... We have a general routine habit. We always have a cell phone in our hand. And we can add this general habit to good habits like burping, getting in shape. So, this book shows an example. After I pull out my phone, I will do 10 burpees. This is a need. We have to burpee. We have to do burpee. This is a good habit. This is a need. After I do 10 burpees, I will check Facebook. Facebook is a want. Supernormal stimuli means want and temptation. We can feel dopamine in our brain to do what we want. But this time, we can use this want for need. Like do 10 burpees. Understand? It's very difficult. Yeah, I think I get it. So, he suggests to do something that you need to do before doing something you want to do. Right? Yeah, right. You are genius. No. Make sense? Yeah. But it's very difficult to do. I mean, it's easier said than done. But we can apply this mechanism to our user life to change our habits or make good habits. But if I imagine I want to watch YouTube using my phone right now, then if that means that I have to do 10 burpees, I mean, I feel like I can easily skip that. If you know what I mean. I'm just going to watch YouTube. I'm just going to pretend that I didn't make any promises like that. Oh, yeah. Right? You have to believe you. So, it's another willpower that I have to pull. Isn't it? I don't know. I don't want to use my willpower. It's precious. Precious? Precious. I have very little willpower. So, I have to use it in a very smart way, very delicately. Right? I have very little willpower. So, I don't want to use it for anything. I want to reserve it for really, really important things. What is important to you? I mean, nowadays, it's for studying. Studying. How about your study? Is it going well? Don't ask. Don't ask? It's falling apart. But it's okay. I'm going to manage. Don't worry about me. Worry about your English, okay? This is our English class. It's English class. Yeah. Okay, okay. Yeah. Don't worry about me. I'm fine. I'm doing okay. This content is chapter A. I said about two chapters to you. It's not easy, but I want to try to explain it. Yeah, and you did a really good job. Ah, yeah. Thank you. It almost reminded me of a professor in university who tried to do English lecture. Yeah. Some lectures are conducted in English, right? So, it almost reminded me of one professor giving me an English lecture when I was in university, when you were talking. Yeah, so it was good. It was very natural. A little bit... It could be more engaging. But it was good. I think your English level was very improved. Really? Yeah. The grammar structures that you use and the vocabularies that you use. But, yeah. You're improving. I appreciate you. Ah, you appreciate me? Yeah, yeah. Thank you. I appreciate you appreciating me. Oh, yeah. Appreciate me. Because of you. No problem. Yeah. This time is 9.41. Is it? It's over one hour. Ah, is it? It's almost two hours. Yeah, it is. It's almost two hours. It's okay. The time passed. Very fast, right? Yeah, time flies. Time flies. Yeah, it was good. So maybe since it's already almost two hours, we can do 20 more minutes so that it could be just two hours. What do you think? I think we can review the friendship. Yeah, right? Friendship, yeah. Good idea. Do you remember? Yeah, I almost forgot. Yeah, it was a long time ago. Yeah, I know. Did you watch the video? Video? I watched it. So, what was it about? Tell me. What was it about? We proceeded the question. What happened? Do you remember? Yeah, I think we did like until number two or something. Yeah. Right? Was it? Yeah. So we did number two. Number two or number three. Number three. I think number three. Yeah, I think number three. I think until number three. Yeah. So, okay, we can move on to number four. So do you agree with the idea of friendship recession? We start with number three. Do we? Okay, okay. So what do you think is the ideal number of friends to have? Both casual and close. I think in casually, I think the friends number is five. Five, about five. About five. And close friends is around three. Three. Why do you think so? I don't want to get something out of friendship, but casually, the more friends we have, the better we go, we feel. The more friends, the better? The more friends we have, the better we can feel. But you can simply just say the more friends, the better. More friends, the better. The more friends, the better. In social relationships, many characters and many backgrounds, the friends can help. The opportunity of a job or economical support in a bad time. For example, we can have a bad situation like someone's death. We have to go to a funeral. In Korea, we need a person to carry the coffin. You need a person to carry the coffin. A person to carry the coffin, five or six guys. In that time, casual friends can help people. Right. Makes sense. Close friends is appropriate because one guy has an unexpected situation and we can lose touch with him. The other, a second guy, we can find him together and hang out with. You can still hang out with the remaining friends. We can be sure to cry on each other without one guy. We might have an argument with one guy. Another guy can mediate the conflict between two guys and help them to reconcile. I think casual friends is around five and close friends is around three. I agree. How about your friendship? Do you have enough friends? My friendship? Not many. In terms of casual or close relationship? Casual relationship is around five, six or seven. Close friends is three or four. These guys don't know each other in some cases. It's not a group of friends, so you know them separately. Separately in relationship. Then you have enough. You have enough. You have an appropriate amount of friends. That's good. I think so. Yeah, that's good. Many casual friends can make someone feel fatigued. I think it's a good friend. It's like a rest. Exactly. You gain energy when you meet them, right? You don't have to feel burdened to meet friends. I agree. Do you agree with the idea of a friendship recession? What factors do you think contribute to this trend? Yeah, I agree with the idea of a friendship recession. The factors include COVID-19, marriage, raising a child, and busy work schedule. Makes sense. Do you think nowadays people are busier than before? Because they say this phenomenon that it's a trend that is accelerating. People are making less and less friends over time. Accelerating? Accelerating. This trend is accelerating. Accelerating. What was the question? What about compared to the past? Do you think nowadays people are busier than before? That's why there's a friendship recession these days. Yeah, I agree with that. People want to make more money. More people. More than before. I think people pay more attention to leisure or vacation. Work-life balance. Work-life balance. So they want to make money in working time. So they earn money more and they want to enjoy the leisure after that. So I think in my case, I want to make money for the future. When I can live somewhere and enjoy leisure with my pet and have a house. Yeah. Then maybe it's the opposite then. Nowadays they work less than before because decades ago people used to work six days a week. But nowadays we work five days a week and we are introducing four days a week. Right? So I feel like the absolute amount of time that people spend working is decreasing. But at the same time, the number of friends they hang out with is decreasing too. So why do you think is that so? Increasing hangout time? Yeah, while they have more free time outside of their work, then they have more time to hang out with friends. But then why are they hanging out with their friends less than before? Yeah, that's what friendship recession is about. People having less friends than before compared to the past. Because they have a family raising a child. People had family before, right? I think nowadays people marry even less than before. Friendship recession. What was it? Yeah, that's right. Yeah. They have more time, they have more money, and people get married less. So they have less responsibilities. I think these days people want to live a private life. They enjoy playing games alone. People want free time alone without friends. People become more private people. Right, right. Makes sense. Do you think COVID-19 may have attributed to that? Attribute? We can have problems with people usually. We can feel inflammation to do with people. We have jobs in the company. We always contact with people that we don't want. And the boss in the company always let some guy to do something. We can feel discomfort with people. I think you made a really good point. Because nowadays people are super connected with one another. Especially via SNS, like Instagram or Facebook. So even though they don't want to, they always have to feel like they're connected to everybody. And they get to see people, they get to know what's up with the people they don't really care about. So I think it's easy to feel fatigue in human relationship in general. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, makes sense. Yeah, so maybe they tend to value their close relationship a little bit less or they take it for granted. Yeah, makes sense. And now I think I don't want many number of friends. Yeah, me neither. And now I want a pet, like a dog. I think it's better to me. Yeah, exactly. Than people. Dogs are the best. Yeah, dogs can be my friend. Yeah, they can be everything. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. The dog cannot betray me. Yeah, they're so precious. Deceive me. Yeah, they're so loyal, right? But people can do betray and deceive and hate. Yeah, fuck them, right? Just kidding. Kidding, just kidding. Yeah, kidding, okay. So next question. Wake me up, wake me up. I'm sorry. Why do you think it becomes harder to make friends as we get older? I think you touched on that a little bit. Like your friends getting married and having kids, having more responsibilities and so on and so forth. Sense of betrayal and distrust. Yeah, exactly. You know more. As you get more experience, you get to experience, you know, how do I say? Like this disgusting parts of people, right? Yeah. Makes sense, makes sense. It's not like all butterfly and rainbow. You know that it's not all butterfly and rainbow. Yeah, right. Right, right. Makes sense. So last question. What does your ideal relationship look like and what effort do you think it takes to achieve it? At first, I admit the concept, I admit the thought that I need friends. And this YouTube video shows that we have to carve out continuously and go work on. The friendship cannot bloom on its own. We have to try to build a relationship with our friends. For example, we can go, we can attend a meeting with friends once a year. And then we can bring up to date of friends, our friends. We can call, we can call friends to check in with them. Yeah. Check what? Check the death or alive. Check if they're alive, check if they're still alive. Yeah, we have to sometimes to check in. Right, right, right. Our friends. That's important. Especially as you get older, right? Yeah. Yeah, my friends. Yeah. They're all alive. That's good, that's good. Me too. Yeah. And we can congratulate or present a gift to our friends. Friends birthday. Right. And staying in touch through calls and messages, text messages also helps maintain our friendship. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, as you said, I think, as you said, celebrating, I think sharing good moments and bad moments of your life with your friends is very important. Yeah, I think so. Yeah, when you're happy, when something good happens, then you need someone to celebrate it with, right? Yeah. Rainy or snowy, we have to check the friends. Rainy, snowy? Rainy or snowy. Ah, right, right, right, right. Right, exactly. Is that right? How do you say rainy or snowy? Rainy or snowy? Whether it rains or snow? Whether it rains or snow. Literally, literally translated. Literally, yeah. Yeah, so I feel like you can just say, you can check in with your friends. Rainy or snowy? Rainy or snowy? Is that what you say at weddings? Oh, really? You say that a lot. Rainy or snowy. Rainy or snowy. Do you have any experience? How are you so good at this? Do you have any experience? I didn't know. Okay. Right, right. Okay. Thank you.",

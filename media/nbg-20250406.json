    "text": "The women can have more psychological problems than men, guys. Output is a psychological problem, disorder. Independent variable is a psychological problem. Dependent variable. Independent is male or female. So female, relatively to men, have more risk for psychological problems. For example, not real. In this case, we can use a ratio. Because men and women. So this ratio equals 1 if... 1 and men ratio equals 1? Men and women ratio is 1. Like 1 vs 1 or 1 vs 2 or something like that? Ratio? Ratio is a ratio? Women, for men, ratio is 1. Ratio is a ratio. So it's 28% or 58%? You can say that. It's the same. It's 1. 1, right? It's the same. If they combine. If 1 is added, it's meaningless. 1 is the same. But if there are more women, the ratio should be bigger than 1. If there are more psychological problems, the ratio should be bigger than 1. Ratio should be bigger than 1. Ratio. If a woman's age or gender has more psychological problems than a man, then it should be bigger than 1 when compared to a man. So the ratio should be bigger than 1. If it's smaller than 1, what will happen? It's bigger than 1? If it's smaller than 1, what will happen? There should be less women. The risk should be lower. But I don't understand that. I don't know why it's called a ratio. The reason why it's called a ratio is because there is a probability analysis. Probability analysis has a result. What should I say? Let's look at the weight. Age, weight, gender, man. When you look at the weight, the average weight is a few kilograms. It should be a few kilograms. There are characteristics that men have. So if it's a few kilograms, it's lower than the average. Or higher. So the average of the sample group is higher than the average of the sample group. It should be like that. Then what are the factors? So we have to analyze the cause. Why is the cause like that? Why are these people higher than the average? We have to analyze whether it's higher or lower. Then we use this expression. What is the factor? What is the risk factor? So it's called risk ratio. Risk ratio. But I don't understand why it's called a ratio. Ratio is literally the probability of something. How many times? How many times? Ratio. It's also a probability. It's also called how many times. But it's usually called how many times. How many times? So how many times is the probability that these people will have this compared to the general situation? That's right. They have this factor. How many times is the probability that these people will become obese? So if there is a job, if there is a job in the workplace, it doesn't mean anything. Whether the job is here or there. So if there is a job, it just means that it's the same as the average person. That's right. It doesn't matter. Then if 0.8 comes out, it's a little lower than this. Then the risk is low. These people. If it's bigger than the job, these people are more dangerous than those people. Then in this case, the reason why 1 should not be included in this section is. But I don't understand this graph. This table. There is no ratio. There is no ratio. I think this is a ratio. Estimate. So this is the effect size. There was some effect, but how much is the effect? Yes, this is the ratio. And this is the error range. Is it an error deviation? It could be. This is the standard error. If you look at this, there is no job. There is no job between 30 and 30, but it is meaningful. Then, in the whole, this is the effect size. The baseline here is pre-treatment. So before treatment. Pre-treatment and post-treatment results. And here they are comparing pre-treatment and follow-up results. So they are not comparing these two. No, they are comparing this, this, and this, this respectively. I can see that. Without number 1. Without this range. This does not include 1. It is effective. 20.33 Post-treatment is effective. This is significant. Not significant. Acceptance is not significant. Not significant. Because 0.94. It includes 1. Not significant. Significant. Significant. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. Not significant. This one is significant. Significant. It is clarity. Follow-up. This group. Less than. Less than. The result was. The follow-up treatment result was relatively low. Than the results of pre-treatment. Pre-treatment result. Yeah, so it was complicated. See? And I still can't find it. Repeat measurement? In one group. Continuously. About this group. Continuously follow-up. Follow-up. The basic premise is to be independent. Comparison of two independent groups. About one group. Continuously follow-up. Yeah, but then. Measure. Measure. Measurement only conducted three times. Pre-treatment. Post-treatment. And follow-up. So it was three months after the treatment. After they ended the treatment. No, no, no, no. There's two groups too. They're comparing active and sham groups. And the time factor as well. These two. ANCOVA. Means repeat measurement. ANCOVA. Repeat measurement. Statistics. This is difficult. Repeat measurement. But what I know is. Because they continuously follow-up and measure. These people. This period, this period, and this period. It's not an independent period. Because they continuously measure the same group. Some of the factors this person has. Because it can continue to affect. ANCOVA. It's a repeat measurement statistic. If it's a different group at each time. It's not a repeat measurement method. It's just a simple comparison. You can do it independently. With something like ANCOVA. But this is. It's supposed to be. Yeah, so actually they used the two models. Linear mixed effect model. And post hoc analysis. That was about the ANVOC. ANCOVA. This is difficult. Yeah, exactly. And actually they said. Linear mixed effect model is more advanced. Than. ANCOVA. ANCOVA. Look at this, Ji-eun. I think there's a statistician. I think. This person in public health. He's a statistician. Yale University. I know that university. Because the people in public health. They're like that. Korean insurance company. That's why they have big data. Right. Those people are statisticians. Makes sense. Because it is difficult, right? It is natural for us to. For us to not understand it, right? We can't do this analysis. Yeah. It was crazy. The statistician joined this article. Yeah, because it's very complicated, right? And then there's. If people like us. They conduct the statistics. There's high probability. That we're going to mess it up, right? If you're not a statistic expert. You're going to mess it up. There's going to be mistakes. We need. Background of statistics. For reading this article. I think. It's very difficult. Just to read about research. And what is the meaning of research. We have to catch them. But we don't understand. Fully this article. Yeah, so what bothered me. Was I could understand this. This figures. Because it was the. Very complicated. Yeah, it was just a mean score. Right, so I could understand this. But I couldn't understand this. This figure. Because it didn't look like. It didn't look like scores, right? But it was like. I don't know how to interpret it. But then here. It mentioned p-value. So they put this. Asteroid here. Indicating the. Statistical significance. So if there's two. It's more significant. And there's three. Even more. Significant, right? So I could only interpret this. Oh, okay. Whatever. I don't know how they figured it out. But they say it is. And then. It is. You have a problem. Because it's more significant. Not. No, no, no, no. Here, here. Meaningless. Meaningless. Just. Just. I think it's. Specific. Because p-value. Is changeable. When. When. Type or sort of. Type of. Kind of. Statistics used. Yeah, makes sense. So. They set the. P-value. Different. Differently. And. But then I heard that. P under this point. Is more significant. Than this. No. No. It's just. P-value. Always. Like below. 0.05. 0.01. 0.23. It's all. Significant. This. Not. More significant this. No. No. I heard that the figure here indicates the possibility that this result was from coincidence. Then it means there's only 5% of possibility that the result was by coincidence. And 0.01 means it's just 1% of possibility that this result was by accident. And this one, 0.1% of possibility that this result was from coincidence. So it means it was more significant from my understanding. That's right. I studied this. Everything has a meaning. Yes, everything has a meaning. The things that don't have a meaning don't have a meaning. The things that have a meaning have a meaning. But there are things that are more significant. Very significant.",
